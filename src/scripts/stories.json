    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed filmmaker, actor, theater director and communications consultant Avijit Dutt, who was at Yuvaan Literature and Film Festival for a panel discussion.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How is theatre different from film industry?</strong></p><p>Completely different. Theatre is here and now. You are sharing time and space and even the breath of the actor, which does not happen in cinema. Cinema is frozen. At the end of the shoot you might say, “<i>Yaar maza nahi aaya, main kuch aur karna chahta tha</i>!” (I wish I could’ve done that differently!), but you don’t have a chance to do that now; it’s frozen. But in theatre, you can say, “<i>Yaar baat nahi bani aaj! Kal kuch aur karte hai</i>.” (Today wasn’t the best. We'll try it differently tomorrow!) and you talk to your co-actors and you build your narrative and the next day you do it and it catches fire with the audience and go like “<i>Wah! Mil gaya raasta! Ab is hi raaste pe jaana hai aage!</i>” (We finally nailed it! This is how we’re going to go at it from now!). However, film has a great advantage. A friend from Canada, a friend from Japan, they can see it from anywhere. The power of Bollywood is just so incredibly fearsome. It is definitely our largest soft power creation and export in the world. There was this one time when our car got stuck in Bhutan and there was this another car and there were these young guys and I was thinking of calling them to help out. So, I waved at them and they waved back. I asked them, “So will you help us?”. And they replied, “Certainly sir! Certainly. We saw you in Ladies V/S Ricky Bahl!”</p><p><strong>The film industry is highly commercialised, whereas in the theatre industry, the people have told us that the audience they get is somewhat limited.</strong></p><p>You know, in '92 when the TV became a huge doorway to entertainment &nbsp;with the opening of satellite channels. Theatre started having a bad time because suddenly people could see it all at home. We're selfish humans and we think what the point is of going outside when we can relax in here. So willy nilly, you get in sucked into a rhythm which is against taking you out, but theatre has been dying for 2000 years. People have been saying that theatre is a dead art for a long time but theatre will not die because the audience keeps coming. But it is so fantastic, I do a show called Unspeakable <i>toh wo solo karta hu </i>English <i>mein karta hu</i> because it’s about criticising the government and I do not want other people to get arrested. &nbsp;So I decided to do a solo first time ever. I went to a festival in Hyderabad and a lot of people came because of the familiar face. It was a full house. But I was worried about what would happen at the second day. The next day there were other people waiting outside asking me to do a second show that night. Then the organiser asked me to stay another day and I was concerned about how it’ll be set up in such a short time space, how the tickets will be sold and everything. He told me to not worry and hence I stayed there for another day and we had another full house. Now to me it’s curious that same play when I bring to Delhi and I don’t say much about it - I didn’t talk to any newspaper or give any interviews. Just decided to put it in the Habitat program notes and see what happens. I had a 120 people but a play before this one that I did at the Habitat, overflowing full house. So you can’t. You really can’t tell. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your opinion on the role of film as a tool to instil patriotism?</strong></p><p>There was this boy with me just after the ‘97 war who joined me by the name of Anurag. He said, ”Sir, I want to join the Army.” His father was in the police and he had a non-commissioned job but he wanted to be in the army, he wanted to be an officer, he wanted to make him proud so he joined the INA and he came out as a Captain and he went to Kashmir where he was posted. So, he came back to meet me in 2011, and I asked him, “What happens if there’s a cross border shoot and they take out 2 of your men?”. He said, “Well, we go and tell the major that we’ll have to take out 4 of their men tomorrow”. This whole business of surgical strikes has been happening immemorially. But we cannot say, “<i>Arre tu toh bada patla sa banda hai</i>” (“You have no strength!”). Thimmaiah said in 1949, “None of my soldiers will ever cross the border to get back revenge.” That was 1949. Subsequently every single day this carries on. Now they’ve made it into a film. Now that it’s 2019, the mark of 20 years of Kargil, Siddharth Roy Kapoor is making a movie called Kargil A Celebration. Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon of shaking a flag and saying “I’m Indian!” Was there ever a question? The question is when you divide society up like that, then it is not being Indian to my mind. Because we are such a wonderfully diverse country. There’s this synagogue in Calcutta which is being revived, which was the first synagogue in india. It’s being revived by a Muslim. So, I went to meet him. I asked him, “So, how are you here being a Muslim?” and he said, “Sir I didn’t think you’d be the kind of person to say something like this. Shouldn’t you be ashamed of yourself?” I said “Of course”. He said “So this is what we are now. Just because I believe in Allah doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate jews.” Such a lovely thing. In UP, there’s this mosque that was rebuilt &nbsp;by a Hindu community. They were rounded up and were asked, “How could you do this?!”. They said, “Well sir with cement and bricks” Can you imagine? Let’s hope that this too shall pass and the country will evolve from such debasing politics.</p><p><strong>There are a lot of theatre festivals organised, like Jairangam. Does the government affect them also in terms of polarising people?</strong></p><p>It does. Earlier when Mr. &nbsp;Vajpayee was in power, Maharangan had invited my production called Bombay Bosnia which was banned in Bombay. So I had done 7 shows of it in Delhi and 3 in Calcutta. Ramgopal Bajaj was the director and he wanted me to play a certain role so I told him that I hadn’t done the video. He told me to just agree and he’d take care of the rest. After my initial contentions, I agreed and the play was selected. Then I said, “If we're going to do this, better book 2 shows simultaneously. Because if there’s going to be a gap of five days in between, authorities might get to know of it and they might try to shut it down.” He said, “Fine, let’s do them both on the same day”. The first show ended and for the second show they were only admitting people with tickets. Outside there was a slogan hearing. ABVP was much much weaker then. So they couldn’t get in but the production carried on. It’s much much difficult now. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sir we also know that you have 2 patents, one is of a toilet and one is of a blood testing and collecting in healthcare. What inspired you to come up with these?</strong></p><p>It’s a strange fact but a fact that rural health is not recorded. We know how many births take place and we know how many pregnancies take place, what is safe motherhood and how many children have survived after 6 months. But nothing else is recorded. So when they say that India suffers from 22% of diabetes it’s utter nonsense. Urban figures are taken and extrapolated. WHO recommends 1 doctor per 1000 people. And what we have is 1 doctor for 11046 people. Out of 100 doctors, 80 would want to work in the city and of the remaining 20, 7-8 leave to practice in the West. So, only 12-13 doctors are left to practice in the rural areas. And village populations are huge. WHO says that to walk to a primary healthcare centre, a villager needs to walk an average of nearly 8 km. Due to the huge number of people in the healthcare centre, it gets hard for the doctor to give them proper attention. They’re hard pressed. So when we collect samples and give them to PHC doctors, those who are really genuine, they are so grateful because they now finally know why that one particular person kept coming back again and again because of weakness. They now know that &nbsp;the person is suffering with high sugar. So I’m doing it out of a necessity. Because it’s not there. So we invented the process. And my name comes as the inventor. We have covered 53,400 people in 76 villages.</p><p><strong>So there are a lot of theatre enthusiasts in this university, who are actively participating in competitions and aspire to be actors one day. What advice do you have for them</strong></p><p>Keep searching. Keep looking inward, keep working on yourself. And see and consume media. That can give you new ways. &nbsp;</p>",

The fact that movies are still one of the largest sources of mass communication in our country led to the formation of the Film Critics Guild. Movies remain an important tool to send out a message to the people and that is why we have a motto at our association that states, ‘Holding Cinema Accountable’.

I believe that the audience knows about the content they wish to consume and they will go to multiplexes if they want to watch a particular movie regardless of what any critic says. I think we should give our people enough credit as they reject any movie with a poor script, direction or acting even though it might be starring popular leads. Critics make a difference when it comes to less popular movies such as ‘Laila Majnu’, a low budget film I reviewed earlier.

So, it is surreal coming back to this prestigious institution.</p><p><strong>Do you think there has been a resurgence in terms of movie content in the past few years?</strong></p><p>‘Content’ is such vast term. You get numerous layers and brilliant plots in the movies today. You might have some exceptions, but movies like Newton and Andhadhun which are excellently researched, edited and written portray progress in terms of the quality of movies. An upcoming mainstream movie titled, ‘Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga’ along with several movies with strong female leads like ‘Naam Shabana’ are prime examples depicting that times are changing, but we still have a long way to go.</p><p><strong>Naseeruddin Shah stated that the films being made should mirror our society, what is your take on his statement?</strong></p><p>I agree with his statement and the fact that directors have a huge responsibility on their shoulders today. The fact that movies are still one of the largest sources of mass communication in our country led to the formation of the Film Critics Guild. Movies remain an important tool to send out a message to the people and that is why we have a motto at our association that states, ‘Holding Cinema Accountable’. We need to keep reminding the public about which film is trying to portray what all aspects and peel the plot of the movie layer by layer to present it in front of the audience for what it actually represents.</p><p><strong>Do you think movie critics affect the earnings of films?</strong></p><p>I don’t think critics have much of an impact on big budget films. I believe that the audience knows about the content they wish to consume and they will go to multiplexes if they want to watch a particular movie regardless of what any critic says. I think we should give our people enough credit as they reject any movie with a poor script, direction or acting even though it might be starring popular leads. Critics make a difference when it comes to less popular movies such as ‘Laila Majnu’, a low budget film I reviewed earlier. People who had missed it watched it later on an OTT platform and thanked me for my suggestion. I believe this is where we make a difference. We give voice to low budget film producers to popularise their content among the audience.</p><p><strong>What are your views on censorship in our country? Do you think changing the title of a movie</strong> <strong>affects the way an audience perceives it?</strong></p><p>According to me, there should not be any censorship in films. We should just have a board to give a certain rating to a film and then let the audience decide whether they want to watch it with their parents, friends or children. The board should not have the authority to delete a scene or mute a piece of dialogue from the film.</p><p>I don’t think changing the title of films affects the perception of the masses about the movie. Last year, Hannah Gadsby’s stand up show was Netflix’s most successful stand up show of the year. It was named ‘Nanette’ for no particular reason. The comedian met a woman named Nanette and named the show after her. There was no mention of the woman in that show, which shows that names and titles are often irrelevant when it comes to films and shows.</p><p><strong>From a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate Yuvaan?</strong></p><p>On a scale of one to ten, Yuvaan 2019 is 12… minutes away from where I live!</p>",

    "body": "<h4><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Chhavi Singh, Computer Engineering who secured a placement as a Software Engineer at Paytm.</strong></i></h4><p><strong>How have the placements for your branch been this year? Please share the highlights of the placements season so far.</strong></p><p>The placement season has been amazing so far with highly reputed tech giants like <strong>Microsoft, Adobe and Flipkart</strong> visiting our campus in the very beginning.&nbsp;<br>Potential startups like <strong>Ixigo and Rivigo</strong>, along with <strong>Undostres </strong>(a Mexican Startup) also marked their presence.<br>Undoubtedly, <strong>Uber and CodeNation </strong>have been the highlight of the 2018-19 placement season so far!</p><p><strong>What did you give more weightage to – The Profile Offered or the Company Reputation?</strong></p><p>I gave an equal amount of weightage to both - the profile offered and the company reputation based on the reviews from seniors. Big companies are often accused of slow growth. So, choosing a profile with viable growth options is always better. Moreover, you could do complete justice to your work only if you enjoy it to the fullest.<br>On the other hand, company's work environment matters a lot, as in the end, the people around you are going to be part of your work life.</p><p><strong>Why did you select the particular profile and what parameters did you consider before making your choice?</strong></p><p>As Paytm has a fast-paced environment with constantly changing requirements, I knew that working with Paytm would be a great opportunity to learn as well as grow.<br>Though my profile, Software Engineer, is a pretty generic profile but factors like freedom to choose the project that you'd like to work on etc. helped me make my choice.</p><p><strong>What were the type of Selection Tests (Rounds)?</strong></p><p>The Cutoff for Paytm was 7 CGPA and the eligible branches were COE, IT, SE, MCE.&nbsp;<br>Other Requirements were that class 10th and 12th percentage must be &gt;= 70%.<br><br>There were in total 4 rounds:<br><strong>1. Online Coding Round: </strong>There were 3 questions to be solved in 75 minutes on&nbsp;<br><strong>Cocubes.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>2. Technical Interview-I:</strong> Problems asked were a mixture of coding&nbsp;<br>questions/puzzles.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. Technical Interview-II: </strong>First, a brief discussion on projects and then a few&nbsp;<br>coding questions were asked.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>4. HR Round: </strong>Evaluation of an individual on the basis of CV and normal&nbsp;<br>discussion about family background, profile offered etc.<br><br><i><strong>P.S. Coding on CoCubes is equivalent to coding on Wordpad, so be prepared!</strong></i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you prepare for the selection tests?</strong></p><p>I started preparing right after we were done with our 6th semester exams.<br>Selection tests focus mainly on the following parts:<br><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Management System and Computer Networks.</strong><br>Apart from this, some companies also judge candidates on <strong>Aptitude</strong> (Quantitative, Logical and Verbal) .<br>I learned algorithms from <i><strong>GeeksForGeeks </strong></i>and practiced questions on <i><strong>Interviewbit.</strong></i><br>To prepare the core subjects, I revised important concepts from the prescribed books and practiced MCQ type questions from GeeksForGeeks subject section.<br>For brushing up Aptitude, <i><strong>Indiabix </strong></i>came through.</p><p><strong>Could you offer some tips to ace the interview round?</strong></p><p><i><strong>1. 'Just say what you do, and do what you say'.</strong></i><br>Hiring managers were not born yesterday. A single question is enough to catch you out on a lie. It causes an embarrassment and an awkward situation for everyone in the room. And once you’ve been caught, you’ve trashed your opportunity to get hired and damaged your reputation.<br><br><i><strong>2. 'If you don't ask now, you'll be embarrassed to answer later'.</strong></i><br>Even if you get stuck somewhere, don't be afraid to ask them for help.

    "body": "<h4><i>DTU Times interviewed Chhavi Singh, Computer Engineering who secured a placement as a Software Engineer at Paytm.</i></h4><p><strong>How have the placements for your branch been this year? Please share the highlights of the placements season so far.</strong></p><p>The placement season has been amazing so far with highly reputed tech giants like <strong>Microsoft, Adobe and Flipkart</strong> visiting our campus in the very beginning.&nbsp;<br>Potential startups like <strong>Ixigo and Rivigo</strong>, along with <strong>Undostres </strong>(a Mexican Startup) also marked their presence.<br>Undoubtedly, <strong>Uber and CodeNation </strong>have been the highlight of the 2018-19 placement season so far!</p><p><strong>What did you give more weightage to – The Profile Offered or the Company Reputation?</strong></p><p>I gave an equal amount of weightage to both - the profile offered and the company reputation based on the reviews from seniors. Big companies are often accused of slow growth. So, choosing a profile with viable growth options is always better. Moreover, you could do complete justice to your work only if you enjoy it to the fullest.<br>On the other hand, company's work environment matters a lot, as in the end, the people around you are going to be part of your work life.</p><p><strong>Why did you select the particular profile and what parameters did you consider before making your choice?</strong></p><p>As Paytm has a fast-paced environment with constantly changing requirements, I knew that working with Paytm would be a great opportunity to learn as well as grow.<br>Though my profile, Software Engineer, is a pretty generic profile but factors like freedom to choose the project that you'd like to work on etc. helped me make my choice.</p><p><strong>What were the type of Selection Tests (Rounds)?</strong></p><p>The Cutoff for Paytm was 7 CGPA and the eligible branches were COE, IT, SE, MCE.&nbsp;<br>Other Requirements were that class 10th and 12th percentage must be &gt;= 70%.<br><br>There were in total 4 rounds:<br><strong>1. Online Coding Round: </strong>There were 3 questions to be solved in 75 minutes on&nbsp;<br><strong>Cocubes.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>2. Technical Interview-I:</strong> Problems asked were a mixture of coding&nbsp;<br>questions/puzzles.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. Technical Interview-II: </strong>First, a brief discussion on projects and then a few&nbsp;<br>coding questions were asked.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>4. HR Round: </strong>Evaluation of an individual on the basis of CV and normal&nbsp;<br>discussion about family background, profile offered etc.<br><br><i><strong>P.S. Coding on CoCubes is equivalent to coding on Wordpad, so be prepared!</strong></i></p><p><strong>How did you prepare for the selection tests?</strong></p><p>I started preparing right after we were done with our 6th semester exams.<br>Selection tests focus mainly on the following parts:<br><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Management System and Computer Networks.</strong><br>Apart from this, some companies also judge candidates on <strong>Aptitude</strong> (Quantitative, Logical and Verbal) .<br>I learned algorithms from <i><strong>GeeksForGeeks </strong></i>and practiced questions on <i><strong>Interviewbit.</strong></i><br>To prepare the core subjects, I revised important concepts from the prescribed books and practiced MCQ type questions from GeeksForGeeks subject section.<br>For brushing up Aptitude, <i><strong>Indiabix </strong></i>came through.</p><p><strong>Could you offer some tips to ace the interview round?</strong></p><p><i><strong>1. 'Just say what you do, and do what you say'.</strong></i><br>Hiring managers were not born yesterday. A single question is enough to catch you out on a lie. It causes an embarrassment and an awkward situation for everyone in the room. And once you’ve been caught, you’ve trashed your opportunity to get hired and damaged your reputation.<br><br><i><strong>2. 'If you don't ask now, you'll be embarrassed to answer later'.</strong></i><br>Even if you get stuck somewhere, don't be afraid to ask them for help. Mostly interviewers know what it is like to be on the other side of the table.<br><br><i><strong>3. 'Something is not for you, until you prove it is really yours'.</strong></i><br>Try to lead the interviewer into the field that you feel the most comfortable&nbsp;<br>in.&nbsp;<br><br>Above them all, stay calm and confident. Sleep well and eat enough before the interview, because it's going to be a long day!</p><p><strong>Any advice you would like to give to the junior students?</strong></p><p>I was not able to secure internship in any reputed company.<i><strong> This was easier to understand but difficult to endure. </strong></i>This was also the time when I finally realized that failure isn't any opposite of success, rather failure is a part of it.<br>What kept me going was my will to never give up and consistent efforts and hard work, helped me to land this opportunity.<br><br>So, juniors, stick to the fight, when you're hardest hit because It's when things go wrong, that you must not quit. :D</p>",

The recruiters were looking for <strong>out of the box thinking</strong> in this round through case studies and guesstimates.<br>After this round 8 students were selected .</p><p><strong>How did you prepare for the selection tests?</strong></p><p>The tests consisted of verbal and quantitative ability, business awareness and some general knowledge questions. I prepared for a month by reading newspapers, solving around 15 to 20 quant questions daily, solving <strong>puzzles from geekforgeeks</strong>, and doing a handful of <strong>guesstimates from Quora </strong>every alternative day.</p><p><strong>Could you offer some tips to ace the interview round?</strong></p><p>To do well in interviews you need to be thorough with your CV, you can be questioned upon anything you have mentioned there. Be confident, be honest and have a subtle smile on your face.<br>Interviews don't just test your knowledge, they are more about how you deal under stress situations and how well you communicate.<br>You need not worry of getting stuck somewhere because the interviewers are always willing to help you and they would appreciate someone who is keen to learn and carry the work with ease.</p><p><strong>Any advice you would like to give to the junior students?</strong><br><br>Try inculcating guesstimates in your daily routine weeks before the commencement of placement process. Good Communication is a must have quality that will take you through. Google a handful of puzzles daily, you may stumble on company-specific puzzles on net. Strong academics will definitely provide you an edge.<br>That's all.<br>I would not suggest to target any company, just keep on your preparation on full swing. Keep working hard and everything else will be taken care of automatically</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Prof. Anu Singh Lather, Pro Vice Chancellor, DTU on the process and experience of setting up the USME, at DTU East Campus.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How has your initial experience at universities such as IPU helped you in the development and progress stride of DTU and its East campus?</strong></p><p>Since I am a professor of management, I served two terms as the Dean at the University School of Management Studies (USMS), IPU. Also, even before I became the Dean, I was one of the founding members of the management school. It was founded in 1999 and I joined in 2000 and I was a part of the team which was instrumental in designing the new program, its curriculum, pedagogy and the treatment of these programs in the aspect of teaching particularly. We designed these curricula in consonance with industries. Hence, the industries contributed upto 90% in terms of the curriculum design, and they suggested that we develop some specialised program, namely ‘MBA in International Marketing’ and ‘MBA in Computer Aided Management’. That was the time of the IT boom and internationalisation of businesses in India and India as a country was beginning to contribute to the international landscape of business. So this was the concept they gave. We tried the new curriculum through these programs and gradually the students got placed but still, it was realised the concept was a bit early for the industry as well as for the students. When our students sat for the placements, we realised that the industry, at that time, was typically looking for generic specialisation such as specialisation in Finance, specialisation in Human Resource Management, specialisation in IT and so on; though the students of the new programs got placed, but a question mark remained on whether we were really focusing on the true curriculum of MBA. MBA in International Marketing had a focus on marketing and therefore, lacked a focus in finance and similarly MBA in Computer Aided Management too lacked in these aspects. During those days, we also started a new BBA program, in Computer Aided Management. The country’s market and business were growing and as a result, it so happened that, in order to ensure employability for students, the degree equivalence in the industry was perceived to be not equivalent to MBA, so we had to restructure everything and then we started offering an MBA General Program. In this program, we kept the focus on these two components, i.e., International Marketing and Computer Aided Management. These components were taken and put as a major thrust in our new curriculum, while overall going for a conventional MBA, consisting of all other necessary subjects. We found that through this exercise, our curriculum became updated and revised, and hence, its acceptability in the industry rose. I will proudly add that the revision and updating of the syllabus is very<i> </i>frequent, as in every 3-4 years.</p><blockquote><p>\"...the treatment of the curriculum content is very close to the industry’s requirement\"</p></blockquote><p>We tried another new program which was absolutely different, MBA (Financial Markets). This was started in collaboration with National Stock Exchange, &nbsp;Mumbai. We also had many other programs on a weekend basis there. I have the experience and background wherein we experimented with new curriculum designing and discarded the ones rejected by the industry and redesigned the programs. We were the risk-takers and the prime movers, and we had the natural advantage of revising the curriculum based purely on international standards. So with this experience, I came here and when I was asked to start an MBA program at East Campus, I thought we should go with an openness to experiment and designing programs which are updated, contemporary and compatible with industry’s requirements. Hence, East Campus’ curriculum is exactly based on this philosophy and meant to fulfil the industry’s requirements. By requirements, I mean the exact components wanted by them, for example, there is a heavy demand of data analytics now. We all know that Big Data Analysis is so crucial to every sector and the hence, the requirement is large. So we thought we should start a program in &nbsp;Business Analytics. In the first phase of East Campus, we started with MBA programs with conventional specialisation such as finance, HR, etc. But the treatment of the curriculum content is very close to the industry’s requirement and also in line with DTU’s own essence of technological input to the students, so that our own students can join the MBA programs. Namely, Knowledge Management is one of the areas which we have designed for the students coming from a technological background and specialised in this area. We kept these two objectives in mind, put everything together and revised the MBA syllabus for the students coming into East Campus. Then, a BBA program was conceived, consisting of the choice based credit system (CBCS), just like the MBA program. Right from day one, the school opened with CBCS included in every curriculum. Therefore, for the first time at BBA level, CBCS was introduced. If you look at the curriculum, you will find discipline-specific electives, which the student can choose second year onwards. We made it as open as possible for a CBCS system. The curriculum is so well designed that the students are as prepared as the first year students in an MBA program.</p><blockquote><p>\"The admitted students as well as the representatives of the industry give us very positive feedback about the curriculum.\"</p></blockquote><p>The third program which we have introduced in the first phase is B.A. Hons. (Economics). You know that Economics is fetching considerable attention today as the subject has evolved to be more scientific and has proved instrumental in data manipulation. Thus, the role of Economics in businesses has become quite useful. Consequently, we introduced this program which will enhance the employability of the students. The curriculum is rigorous, with mathematics as a major part. The admitted students as well as the representatives of the industry give us very positive feedback about the curriculum. Even for first year students in MBA, there is an open-elective system in place to allow them to choose Yoga, NCC, NSS, etc. as a subject, which has become an integral part of the two-credits system. These electives are compulsory so that there is an all-round development of the students, being from the management stream. We then introduced MBA in Business Analytics, with an intake of 30 students to begin with, because we are still trying to assess the pulse of the acceptance of the industry.</p><p><strong>The DSM has existed for a long time. So, essentially DTU now has two parallel MBA programs, being offered at different locations. What led to this, and how does the management cope with it now?</strong></p><p>In the requirement for Delhi-NCR, specifically, East Delhi was often neglected. We found that the students in the Eastern part of Delhi did not have access to a university or a good educational program. They often travel all the way to the other part of the city in order to get into a BBA or any other entrepreneurial program. Also, the BBA program of the IPU has been well received. Therefore, to cater to these needs of the student population of East Delhi, the USME was set up. There was no government institution offering any such programs in that part of the city. In fact, the Delhi government welcomed this idea.</p><blockquote><p>\"I always tell the students at USME that the DSM is your elder brother.\"</p></blockquote><p>Entrepreneurship is what we have focused on. We did not want simply a B-school creating employees, but we wanted a B-school which would create employers. Hence, the name of the school, University School of Management and Entrepreneurship, with Entrepreneurship as the major thrust there. The pedagogy and the exposure bestowed on the students is to enable them to create and run their own businesses. We already had major workshops and national business competitions last year. Lots of technical sessions were held at USME. Also, we have shifted few incubatees to the East Campus, from the main campus of DTU, so that the right environment is provided to them. A centre for entrepreneurship has been created for the same, at East Campus. Its objective is to guide and drive the incubatees towards idea generation, imparting all the required knowledge. This is an independent centre, which is working very closely with the industry. Thus, the thrust for the B-School at E.C. is not just an MBA program, rather, creating more number of entrepreneurs and consequently, more number of startups.</p><p><strong>How has been the reception of the school by the students and by the general public?</strong></p><p>I always tell the students at USME that the DSM is your elder brother. We have our first batch passing out from USME this year. We have already had the Pre-Placement Talks and the appointments happening. We have tried to position the MBA program at USME in line with the placements. In fact, we have found that when we presented the students from DSM and USME together for placements, a large number of students were getting placed from USME. That is one big motivating factor for us now. There is no difference in terms of perception by the employers. Also, we are happy to share that there are two companies which have exclusively interviewed our students at USME.</p><blockquote><p>\"We aim to make a special place for USME in the country...\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>Is there a plan for USME to become one of the top management institutes of the country? Please share the future plans for USME.</strong></p><p>Yes, it is the target for USME. In fact, the very inception of the school despite the existence of a B-school, DSM, was to provide another B-school with a flavour of nuances of business which are accepted by the industry and with more creative elements in the curricula, so that we can be differentiated as a highly enriched B-school and this part has come from the curriculum design and the delivery through pedagogy. Involving the industry, the corporate houses and the experts has already begun there. East Campus is humming with industrial input and by that I mean, every day you will find a trainer group present to train students for industry level confidence. Since the students have come into the institute through a qualifying examination, we assume that they have the necessary skill level in their inventories. We are enhancing their confidence, the ability to deliver efficiently and effectively and industry readiness. That’s how we believe that our B-school, USME, will be an example where the connect between the students and industry will be the driving force. We aim to make a special place for USME in the country, and hope that in the coming times we are able to meet our aim.</p><p><strong>In the whole process of establishing USME and running it, for example, in designing the curriculum, has there been any constraint in the setting up the institution from the government’s side or the authorities’ side?</strong></p><p>No, in fact the Delhi Government supported the idea of having one such B-school at DTU’s East Campus and also, internally there was a lot support generated for the same right from the start. Hon’ble Chief Minister and Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister went extra an mile, giving us all kind of support for the infrastructure needed. The building where the campus was supposed to take over from, was to be taken from Shaheed Sukhdev College, which was an already functioning college. So the campus started from the building which had already existed for many years, instead of renting a building or constructing a new one. Though the building required renovation and repairs, for making the classrooms new and presentable. In all, the whole process of acquiring the land, constructing a building, etc. which otherwise would have taken a long time, was bypassed and instead, a ready-to-move-in building was allotted. This was the biggest support for us, as within a short span of a month after the take-over, we were able to conduct classes in the new classrooms, which are state-of-the-art classrooms.</p><p>We are thankful and obliged to the Government of Delhi, for being a part of this journey and for standing by us. Also, the new building, which will be inaugurated in February will give a feel of a B-school infrastructure which is contemporary and designed for management education. We have got activity rooms, a Corporate Relations Cell (CRC) as well as an independent unit, an Interaction With Cell (IWC) and three more centres. Hence, we have created the infrastructure as per the requirement of delivering management education.</p><p><i>The second part of the interview will focus on International and Alumni Affairs.</i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Prof. Anu Singh Lather, Pro Vice Chancellor, DTU on the process and experience of setting up the USME, at DTU East Campus.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How has your initial experience at universities such as IPU helped you in the development and progress stride of DTU and its East campus?</strong></p><p>Since I am a professor of management, I served two terms as the Dean at the University School of Management Studies (USMS), IPU. Also, even before I became the Dean, I was one of the founding members of the management school. It was founded in 1999 and I joined in 2000 and I was a part of the team which was instrumental in designing the new program, its curriculum, pedagogy and the treatment of these programs in the aspect of teaching particularly. We designed these curricula in consonance with industries. Hence, the industries contributed upto 90% in terms of the curriculum design, and they suggested that we develop some specialised program, namely ‘MBA in International Marketing’ and ‘MBA in Computer Aided Management’. That was the time of the IT boom and internationalisation of businesses in India and India as a country was beginning to contribute to the international landscape of business. So this was the concept they gave. We tried the new curriculum through these programs and gradually the students got placed but still, it was realised the concept was a bit early for the industry as well as for the students. When our students sat for the placements, we realised that the industry, at that time, was typically looking for generic specialisation such as specialisation in Finance, specialisation in Human Resource Management, specialisation in IT and so on; though the students of the new programs got placed, but a question mark remained on whether we were really focusing on the true curriculum of MBA. MBA in International Marketing had a focus on marketing and therefore, lacked a focus in finance and similarly MBA in Computer Aided Management too lacked in these aspects. During those days, we also started a new BBA program, in Computer Aided Management. The country’s market and business were growing and as a result, it so happened that, in order to ensure employability for students, the degree equivalence in the industry was perceived to be not equivalent to MBA, so we had to restructure everything and then we started offering an MBA General Program. In this program, we kept the focus on these two components, i.e., International Marketing and Computer Aided Management. These components were taken and put as a major thrust in our new curriculum, while overall going for a conventional MBA, consisting of all other necessary subjects. We found that through this exercise, our curriculum became updated and revised, and hence, its acceptability in the industry rose. I will proudly add that the revision and updating of the syllabus is very<i> </i>frequent, as in every 3-4 years.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"...the treatment of the curriculum content is very close to the industry’s requirement\"</i></p></blockquote><p>We tried another new program which was absolutely different, MBA (Financial Markets). This was started in collaboration with National Stock Exchange, &nbsp;Mumbai. We also had many other programs on a weekend basis there. I have the experience and background wherein we experimented with new curriculum designing and discarded the ones rejected by the industry and redesigned the programs. We were the risk-takers and the prime movers, and we had the natural advantage of revising the curriculum based purely on international standards. So with this experience, I came here and when I was asked to start an MBA program at East Campus, I thought we should go with an openness to experiment and designing programs which are updated, contemporary and compatible with industry’s requirements. Hence, East Campus’ curriculum is exactly based on this philosophy and meant to fulfil the industry’s requirements. By requirements, I mean the exact components wanted by them, for example, there is a heavy demand of data analytics now. We all know that Big Data Analysis is so crucial to every sector and the hence, the requirement is large. So we thought we should start a program in &nbsp;Business Analytics. In the first phase of East Campus, we started with MBA programs with conventional specialisation such as finance, HR, etc. But the treatment of the curriculum content is very close to the industry’s requirement and also in line with DTU’s own essence of technological input to the students, so that our own students can join the MBA programs. Namely, Knowledge Management is one of the areas which we have designed for the students coming from a technological background and specialised in this area. We kept these two objectives in mind, put everything together and revised the MBA syllabus for the students coming into East Campus. Then, a BBA program was conceived, consisting of the choice based credit system (CBCS), just like the MBA program. Right from day one, the school opened with CBCS included in every curriculum. Therefore, for the first time at BBA level, CBCS was introduced. If you look at the curriculum, you will find discipline-specific electives, which the student can choose second year onwards. We made it as open as possible for a CBCS system. The curriculum is so well designed that the students are as prepared as the first year students in an MBA program.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"The admitted students as well as the representatives of the industry give us very positive feedback about the curriculum.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>The third program which we have introduced in the first phase is B.A. Hons. (Economics). You know that Economics is fetching considerable attention today as the subject has evolved to be more scientific and has proved instrumental in data manipulation. Thus, the role of Economics in businesses has become quite useful. Consequently, we introduced this program which will enhance the employability of the students. The curriculum is rigorous, with mathematics as a major part. The admitted students as well as the representatives of the industry give us very positive feedback about the curriculum. Even for first year students in MBA, there is an open-elective system in place to allow them to choose Yoga, NCC, NSS, etc. as a subject, which has become an integral part of the two-credits system. These electives are compulsory so that there is an all-round development of the students, being from the management stream. We then introduced MBA in Business Analytics, with an intake of 30 students to begin with, because we are still trying to assess the pulse of the acceptance of the industry.</p><p><strong>The DSM has existed for a long time. So, essentially DTU now has two parallel MBA programs, being offered at different locations. What led to this, and how does the management cope with it now?</strong></p><p>In the requirement for Delhi-NCR, specifically, East Delhi was often neglected. We found that the students in the Eastern part of Delhi did not have access to a university or a good educational program. They often travel all the way to the other part of the city in order to get into a BBA or any other entrepreneurial program. Also, the BBA program of the IPU has been well received. Therefore, to cater to these needs of the student population of East Delhi, the USME was set up. There was no government institution offering any such programs in that part of the city. In fact, the Delhi government welcomed this idea.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"I always tell the students at USME that the DSM is your elder brother.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Entrepreneurship is what we have focused on. We did not want simply a B-school creating employees, but we wanted a B-school which would create employers. Hence, the name of the school, University School of Management and Entrepreneurship, with Entrepreneurship as the major thrust there. The pedagogy and the exposure bestowed on the students is to enable them to create and run their own businesses. We already had major workshops and national business competitions last year. Lots of technical sessions were held at USME. Also, we have shifted few incubatees to the East Campus, from the main campus of DTU, so that the right environment is provided to them. A centre for entrepreneurship has been created for the same, at East Campus. Its objective is to guide and drive the incubatees towards idea generation, imparting all the required knowledge. This is an independent centre, which is working very closely with the industry. Thus, the thrust for the B-School at E.C. is not just an MBA program, rather, creating more number of entrepreneurs and consequently, more number of startups.</p><p><strong>How has been the reception of the school by the students and by the general public?</strong></p><p>I always tell the students at USME that the DSM is your elder brother. We have our first batch passing out from USME this year. We have already had the Pre-Placement Talks and the appointments happening. We have tried to position the MBA program at USME in line with the placements. In fact, we have found that when we presented the students from DSM and USME together for placements, a large number of students were getting placed from USME. That is one big motivating factor for us now. There is no difference in terms of perception by the employers. Also, we are happy to share that there are two companies which have exclusively interviewed our students at USME.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"We aim to make a special place for USME in the country...\"</i></p></blockquote><p><strong>Is there a plan for USME to become one of the top management institutes of the country? Please share the future plans for USME.</strong></p><p>Yes, it is the target for USME. In fact, the very inception of the school despite the existence of a B-school, DSM, was to provide another B-school with a flavour of nuances of business which are accepted by the industry and with more creative elements in the curricula, so that we can be differentiated as a highly enriched B-school and this part has come from the curriculum design and the delivery through pedagogy. Involving the industry, the corporate houses and the experts has already begun there. East Campus is humming with industrial input and by that I mean, every day you will find a trainer group present to train students for industry level confidence. Since the students have come into the institute through a qualifying examination, we assume that they have the necessary skill level in their inventories. We are enhancing their confidence, the ability to deliver efficiently and effectively and industry readiness. That’s how we believe that our B-school, USME, will be an example where the connect between the students and industry will be the driving force. We aim to make a special place for USME in the country, and hope that in the coming times we are able to meet our aim.</p><p><strong>In the whole process of establishing USME and running it, for example, in designing the curriculum, has there been any constraint in the setting up the institution from the government’s side or the authorities’ side?</strong></p><p>No, in fact the Delhi Government supported the idea of having one such B-school at DTU’s East Campus and also, internally there was a lot support generated for the same right from the start. Hon’ble Chief Minister and Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister went an extra mile, giving us all kind of support for the infrastructure needed. The building where the campus was supposed to take over from, was to be taken from Shaheed Sukhdev College, which was an already functioning college. So the campus started from the building which had already existed for many years, instead of renting a building or constructing a new one. Though the building required renovation and repairs, for making the classrooms new and presentable. In all, the whole process of acquiring the land, constructing a building, etc. which otherwise would have taken a long time, was bypassed and instead, a ready-to-move-in building was allotted. This was the biggest support for us, as within a short span of a month after the take-over, we were able to conduct classes in the new classrooms, which are state-of-the-art classrooms.</p><p>We are thankful and obliged to the Government of Delhi, for being a part of this journey and for standing by us. Also, the new building, which will be inaugurated in February will give a feel of a B-school infrastructure which is contemporary and designed for management education. We have got activity rooms, a Corporate Relations Cell (CRC) as well as an independent unit, an Interaction With Cell (IWC) and three more centres. Hence, we have created the infrastructure as per the requirement of delivering management education.</p><p><i>Part II will focus on International and Alumni Affairs.</i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed IPS Officer (Retd.) AP Durai, former Director General, Karnataka Police, who was at DTU in Yuvaan Literature and Film Festival (YLFF '19).</strong></i></p><p><strong>You discovered that bringing about law and order within oneself was a prerequisite for one’s role as a police officer. How can this be applied to any other occupation?</strong></p><p>Bringing law and order within oneself is much more difficult than in the outside world. In the exterior world, we may use external forces and people obey out of fear, and follow orders to keep discipline. But to change from within, we need to take steps ourselves, without any external instructions given by any outside authorities. We need to regulate our thought process, especially our mind, which influences all our actions. Order is the regulation of thought and law. This is referred to as the law of <i>karma </i>or <i>sanskaras</i>. These are based on actions and reactions- evil thoughts, jealousy and ambition creates ripples in our consciousness which leads to regrettable actions. We repeatedly tend to create impressions based on our flawed thought processes and get into a vicious cycle where our thoughts lead to unfortunate actions. Law of <i>karma</i> teaches us to strengthen our thoughts and get rid of our ego. It defines a spiritual process to stop creating foul impressions and exhausting all previous biased impressions. Our minds are slaves to our thoughts and we need to transmit the spiritual essence into our hearts and clear up past opinions to free the present memory. The easiest way to achieve this is to meditate and say a simple prayer. These conditions help you toughen your mind and brings it under regulation. This is different than controlling your mind; it is merely directing it towards the divine presence in each of our hearts. Slowly implementing this process leads to acceptance of life as it unravels before you, it teaches you the art of accepting your destiny and waiting for events to unfold, rather than engineering things to happen in life.</p><p><strong>In the book you've cited that the computerisation of payrolls was a success by the Police Computer Wing, but still that of crime and crime data weren’t. You developed a software and got it installed in the districts, but due to the lack of funds you had to trade-off with lower technology. How do you think these financial impediments are keeping India on the backfoot?</strong></p><p>Policing, prevention of crime and maintenance of law and order cannot suffer due to lack of certain facilities. In the police department, everything needed to be handwritten and managed in files and registers. We need to comprehend that administration and all officers can excel with or without technology. The gap between the latest technologies and common people always exists. The major impediment is not the technology available but the philosophy of the department. They should have the fact ingrained that they are in service of the public and not themselves. They need to operate without any fear or prejudice. These poisons of ambition and pride that corrupt the department need to be extinguished by the liberation of the spirit and overcoming of one’s internal struggles. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>You've also served as Director of NPA. What changes have you seen in the training and attitude of regular recruits at your time and off late?</strong></p><p>The methodology and technology have seen upgradation and facilities are constantly being improved. NPA is no longer the small school we had in Mount Abu, but is now a modern institution. The facility does not lag behind in technology, however, the value system injected in the young police officers is not satisfactory. We see news about numerous IPS officers and officers at several other ranks pursuing wrong motives, often surrounded by scandals or committing suicide due to unfortunate circumstances. This points out that something crucial is missing in their training. The law of <i>karma </i>and <i>sanskaras </i>that I have mentioned in my book is inescapable. Everyone needs to accept the fact and it needs to be present in the consciousness of every police officer. They need to be trained to listen to their hearts, as on different occasions the mind complicates things since it is often filled with pride, jealousy and desires. All of us have been given free will and we need to exercise it and connect with our inner self through meditation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What message would you like to give to the students?</strong></p><p>The coming generation is the promise of future, integrity, idealism and honesty. All of us are dependent on them. The future generation must develop strong ideals and principles to guide them throughout their lives. They should be strong enough to uphold these values in times of fear. They need to grasp the fact that self-confidence is the key to internal power, and one always needs to protect the light within oneself to stay true to one's heart and morals.</p>",

How do you find time out of your busy police schedule to maintain such a diverse lifestyle?</strong></p><p>I read somewhere, <i>A busy man has time for everything. </i>When I wake up in the morning, I write down all the things that I have to do, both professional and personal, in my diary. When you plan out everything, things fall in place. It always happens that when you desire something properly, it happens. Value your time and other people’s time. Learn to prioritise. My staff also is supportive, they also work as per my schedule.</p><p><strong>There has been a decrease in crime rate in India. What is your say on this?</strong></p><p>It depends on the type of crime. In the 90s, snatching money and jewellery was considered a severe crime, but today cyber crime has taken its place. It doesn’t affect you directly, but then it's costing crores of rupees. The police has to keep pace with the latest developments. There's a lot of pressure on police, but the fact remains that crime will never stop until humans are alive. The police has to take this as a challenge and prevent them as much as possible.</p><p><strong>How do you think the police is keeping up with cyber crimes? How can the engineering students, with all their technological know-how, help the police in solving such things?</strong></p><p>The police personnel are not always technologically inclined, but we know that you people are. They aren't well versed with Whatsapp, Skype, etc. So we'll seek your help to understand these things and apply them for the benefit of all. As an IPS Officer, my job is to make people work. I'll ensure that this happens and I'll make use of all the available resources, it's common sense! Some people are good working on the field, some are good with technology, I'll have to ensure that my team has proper balance of all the people.</p><p><strong>After your book, a movie is also being made on your life. Movies often tend to drift away from reality and drive the story to a happy ending. How do you think your movie is going to turn out?</strong></p><p>Yes, movies usually deviate from reality. But the movie world is a make-believe world, I have no complaints against it. Some movies have shown police in very bad light, but many have portrayed police in good light also. Things are changing gradually. In recent movies like <i>Singham</i> and <i>Simba</i>, the cop is shown as the hero. I'm hopeful that my movie will turn out good. I've kept the story in my book as real as possible, far away from dramatisation.</p><p><strong>What's your message to the youth, since there has been a drastic increase in the number of youth criminals?</strong></p><p>There is no shortcut to success. The harder your work, the more you succeed. Enjoy the whole process. Follow your own dreams, and not someone else's. Think about what makes you happy. Most crimes are committed when people go after societal norms of happiness. People go after things which you do not desire, but just because of approval from society. I also enjoy good things in life, but I don't go crazy after them.</p>",

    "body": "<p>With that time of the year again, a fest-filled February stands back and beholds the coming of the largest tech-fest of DTU till date: <i><strong>Invictus</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what exactly is <i><strong>Invictus</strong></i>?&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>is one of its kind umbrella tech-fest being jointly organized by all the technical societies of DTU. It aims to be a platform for all the upcoming technocrats to interact, observe, and compete with each other to see who's the best in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, so what events will <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>be hosting?&nbsp;<br>Being the brainchild of all the techies of DTU coming together under one big hood(ie), there's no doubt that <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>will be a powerhouse of amazing events and extraordinary people. Just because it's a tech-fest, doesn't mean that there's nothing for the rest of us. <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>has all of us covered with enough non-tech events to engage us till the very last minute. To give you an idea of how fun is going to be, here are just some of its events:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Pawn stars:</strong> All of us fell in love with Ron when he played chess to let Harry go forth. This is your Ron moment! Pawn Stars gives you a chance to play life sized chess against the smartest people to see who's the last man standing.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Programmer's DATE:</strong> It doesn't matter if your stars align or not, what matters is that your code should. This event not only checks your coding skills but how compatible it is with your partner's. Because making babies is too mainstream, <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>is going to have you make code instead <i>*winks*</i>.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>is more than these exhilarating events, though. It successfully hosted 15k people last year and the number is only expected to be higher this year because of the sheer effort and creativity that has gone in its making. Each member of <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>has intensely worked and brainstormed for countless number of nights in the past months to make this year’s version even more fabulous than the last one, to make sure that this legacy is honored as it deserves to be. &nbsp;</p><p>Because of every different technical society collaborating with each other, <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>is a concubine of very diverse events made by people who know their event inside out, meticulously. &nbsp;Tech-fests are inherently different than cultural fests in terms of the competition that can be felt in the air. All the best coders and techies are put together in a campus to battle out each other’s mettle and see where everyone stands. They code so furiously that you cannot know what’s working faster, their mind or their fingers. With these passionately beautiful people in mind, <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>was made to be everything that they like. From great mind-jolting events to light-hearted fun to great food, <i><strong>Invictus </strong></i>offers everything to not let you leave.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the flagship technical event of an esteemed technological university, there's no way it fails to deliver on everything that we've been waiting for.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Prof. Anu Singh Lather, Pro Vice Chancellor, DTU on progress in the International and Alumni Affairs departments.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Apart from the East Campus, you have been closely involved with two main other departments at DTU’s main campus, International Affairs and Alumni Affairs. As students, when we compare the university with ranks of IITs and other colleges, we find that there is insufficient linkage between DTU and any reputable university abroad. How has this aspect improved in the last 1-2 years?</strong></p><p>We have strengthened the Department of International Affairs and we currently have a full-time Dean of International Affairs, Prof. Vishal Verma, who looks after the same. We also augmented the two offices, International Affairs and Alumni Affairs by making them independent units, supported by the right kind of team and infrastructure. So we have two Deans now, as opposed to earlier, when the Dean of International Affairs was looking after the Alumni Affairs as well. We did not want to merge the responsibilities of one division with another, as this was unjustifiable. Hence, we created the new position as internationalisation is altogether a different mandate for the university. You have rightly stated that that we need linkages with foreign universities. Alumni play a very important role in it. With DTU being a veteran university known to everyone abroad as DCE, we thought that let us pick the threads from the past. In the past too, there have been efforts in making some contacts with the International Alumni. Our national alumni network is quite strong, existing as the Alumni Association They have this tradition of meeting annually. We have provided them an office at the main campus, with staff, so that they can be connected to the students and others. It apparently needed a more serious and active role of the administration, thus we allotted an independent Alumni Dean and office, where he is now taking up all the work.</p><blockquote><p>\"...internationalisation is altogether a different mandate for the university.\"</p></blockquote><p>Recently, I was on a personal visit in the US, where incidentally, I received an invitation from Mr. Durga Das Agrawal, the illustrious alumnus of DCE, to visit him and some 30 other alumni in Houston. In the meanwhile, we were also moving some papers for signing an MoU with Cullen College of Engineering, Houston University. So I went from L.A. to Houston and met these people. That became the beginning to flag off the International Alumni Association of DTU, in a grand form. The 4-5 hours long meeting was emotional as they were moved by the fact that somebody from DTU had visited them. They felt quite committed about it, as the emotional connect was very strong. They then decided to contribute some share of money towards our donation funds. Right on the same day, they circulated a paper to everybody to commit something and the commitment on the table came out to be around twenty thousand dollars. This became the start of the feeling of doing something for DTU. Dr. Durga Das Agrawal and Mr. Mahesh Joshi decided to take the initiative forward and connected to us, back here. They created an Alumni Association, formally got it registered in the US and finished the formal process for establishing it. Next year, the meeting was held in San Francisco, where the participation was 200 people, coming from all over the continent. People like Pramod Haq, who in the US, is known as ‘the man with a midas touch’ since he is a popular venture capitalist and Prof. Yogi Goswami, whose air purifier has become a commercial and popular product across the country. Mr Goswami is a professor at Florida University. I meet alumni who were the front runners in various areas. It was such a pleasure!</p><blockquote><p>\"...they were moved by the fact that somebody from DTU had visited them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Coming back, we took it forward and we have got a contribution of five crore rupees, from Dr. Raj Soin, who has donated this amount for the creation of a multi-purpose hall, named after him, for the students. In the meanwhile, the money is flowing through the alumni platform. Money is not the sole connect we have with alumni. Since Mr Agrawal is also the senator at Houston University, he was instrumental in getting the MOU with Cullen College signed. The MoU is active, there are two PhD scholars who were offered paid internships at Houston University and they have applied for the same. Thus, the linkages have already started establishing and in the same way, there is a long list of MoUs which have been signed with international universities.</p><p><strong>How have the signed MOUs helped so far?</strong></p><p>I feel that proactiveness and action on the part of the HoDs will help in a big way. What should happen is, the areas in which the students are to be versed in, have to be identified. Therefore, an active participation of HoDs into execution of MoUs results in their success. The connection from HoD to HoD and Dean to Dean needs to be taken forward. Also, a general consensus should be present to process everything, without which we cannot communicate with the collaborating institutes. Hence, an MoU is the basic requirement to go ahead with a collaborative proposal. If there is no MoU, the foreign universities will not acknowledge the partnership. This is how MoUs become crucial, but active participation of the faculties is required to make them successful.</p><blockquote><p>\"internationalisation of education... is happening all over the globe.\"</p></blockquote><p>Coming to internationalisation of education, it is happening all over the globe. We were a little late in doing so. We were only admitting students through DASA, Direct Admission for Students Abroad. The students were coming through the DASA route. But we found that majority of such students were NRIs, rather than foreign nationals. It did not exactly bring in the culture of international students. So we decided to create a separate, new window, wherein, only foreign students were eligible for admissions. We started this in 2017. We created another admissions windows, admission through ICCR and SII. This year we have admitted 174 foreign students through these routes, as opposed to last year, when 28 students were admitted; they are representing 42 countries. It is a great learning as these students bring in the deposit of their own cultural identity, space, level of understanding and skills. It also improves the ranking of the university; universities cannot even participate in such rankings if the internationalisation has not happened. This has been a conscious effort by the university, to create the international office, augment and support it, and we have been successful so far in doing so.</p><p>Beyond internationalisation, we also have exchange activities like student exchanges, faculty exchanging and even exchanges of PhD theses, as they are sent abroad for evaluation and evaluation of thesis of international scholars by our teachers.</p><p>As I said, that some of the activities have started, but it needs to happen en masse. Because we have just began last year, in the framework of the MoU, the HoDs can identify and tell us the areas to be involved in. The International office would be instrumental in fixing the exchange programs. To begin with, the students should be made aware about these windows and they should approach the HoDs for the enrolling in these programs.</p><p><a href=\"http://dtutimes.dtu.ac.in/blog/interview-prof-anu-singh-lather-pro-vc-part-i-east-campus-751\"><i>Part I</i></a><i> of the interview focussed on DTU East Campus.</i></p>",

Working for BCG not only brings in the perks of working with the intellectual and articulate people but also gives you the kind of exposure that makes us stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;<br>My profile is DRS which gives me an opportunity to work in different domains first and then select the one that interests me the most. BCG is one of the most well reputed companies to work at and this profile gives me flexibility to explore thoroughly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why did you select the particular profile and what parameters did you consider before making your choice?</strong></p><p>I opted for<strong>&nbsp;Data and Research Services</strong>&nbsp;because it provided with a great opportunity to work in all the areas of the company which will give a good insight to all the aspects of how the work is carried on.&nbsp;<br>Plus getting hands on experience in working in all departments makes it easier to understand how to go about working and improving my performance and the company’s outputs.<br>I would be working with and under people who are experts in their fields and thus will get a lot of learning opportunities to widen my horizons and will get freedom to drive my research work.</p><p><strong>What were the type of Selection Tests (Rounds)?</strong></p><p>The cutoff was&nbsp;<strong>6 CGPA&nbsp;</strong>and was open for all branches.</p><p><strong>Round 1: Aptitude Test</strong><br>There were a total of 50 questions and the duration of the test was 50 minutes. Around 350 students appeared for the test out of which 68 were shortlisted for further rounds.<br><br><strong>Round 2 : General Interview&nbsp;</strong><br>There were 4 panels for the interviews. All the students were divided into different groups and allocated a panel number. This interview was all about checking your confidence, and communication skills.<br>We were questioned about ourselves, our family and educational background our future vision and things that interest us.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Round 3 : CV Based + Guesstimates&nbsp;</strong><br>Around 22 people where shortlisted and in this interview round the students were asked about their CV, the kind of work they carried out in college. They were asked about their branches and why they opted for them. Then they were asked to solve a guesstimate under limited time.<br><br><strong>Round 4 : Final Interview&nbsp;</strong><br>Around 14 students were filtered and In this round we were bombarded with circumstantial business situations and strategies. The recruiters were looking for&nbsp;<strong>out of the box thinking</strong>&nbsp;in this round through case studies and guesstimates.<br>After this round 8 students were selected .</p><p><strong>How did you prepare for the selection tests?</strong></p><p>The tests consisted of verbal and quantitative ability, business awareness and some general knowledge questions. I prepared for a month by reading newspapers, solving around 15 to 20 quant questions daily, solving&nbsp;<strong>puzzles from geeksforgeeks</strong>, and doing a handful of&nbsp;<strong>guesstimates from Quora&nbsp;</strong>every alternative day.</p><p><strong>Could you offer some tips to ace the interview round?</strong></p><p>To do well in interviews you need to be thorough with your CV, you can be questioned upon anything you have mentioned there. Be confident, be honest and have a subtle smile on your face.<br>Interviews don't just test your knowledge, they are more about how you deal under stress situations and how well you communicate.<br>You need not worry of getting stuck somewhere because the interviewers are always willing to help you and they would appreciate someone who is keen to learn and carry the work with ease.</p><p><strong>Any advice you would like to give to the junior students?</strong><br><br>Try inculcating guesstimates in your daily routine weeks before the commencement of placement process. Good Communication is a must have quality that will take you through. Google a handful of puzzles daily, you may stumble on company-specific puzzles on net. Strong academics will definitely provide you an edge.<br>That's all.<br>I would not suggest to target any company, just keep on your preparation on full swing. Keep working hard and everything else will be taken care of automatically</p>",

The quality of education at our place is much lower, which is why we came here. I also find the curriculum to be very different. Even though my curriculum was in English, one of my friend’s curriculum was in Arabic. Hence he finds everything very complicated and it is difficult to cope, especially for him and many others like him. But we believe that skills are very important, regardless of what field we choose. Hence, no matter how much we study, knowledge is endless. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Why did you choose DTU specifically, over other colleges?&nbsp;</strong><br>Since DTU is complete with all technological facilities, I am sure that we will gain an immense amount of knowledge.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Did you find any stark cultural differences and how did you find adjusting with them?&nbsp;</strong><br>There are a lot of cultural differences, one of them being that most Somali women don’t usually wear sarees unless at weddings.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Did you attend our recent college fests?

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Vineet Singh Hukmani, MD and CEO, 94.3 Radio One who was one of the chief speakers at E-summit'19 organised by E-cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>You're living a life every Engineer aspires to live; first an Engineering degree and then a Management degree, what has kept you motivated all this while?</strong></p><p>Education and degree are just a means to an end. It's important to have good education with respect to what you learn. During our young days, we had limited options. We could do either Medicine or Engineering. A lot more learning has happened post that. Today's education system is very different, where even a homeschooled child can learn a lot. I've met a couple of kids who haven't taken any formal education but learn from the Internet. Hence, I think education is an important thing to have and it doesn't matter how you get it.</p><p><strong>During your talk you talked about how the radio is way more personalized and relevant as compared to the streaming services. What are the disruptive things that you plan to tackle so as to let ‘Radio One’ stay relevant?</strong></p><p>It's a simple philosophy that when you look at something differently, you start getting ideas. We don't look at radio as <i>radio</i>, we look at it as forced social media. After the <i>1970s</i>, when radio became popular, it had all the advantages of social media like one-to-one interaction and free expression. On Facebook you might be following travel or cookery pages, we allow you to do that on radio as well. Our one philosophy and technique to take <strong>Radio One</strong> further is to cater to a tribe of International Indians. Our behavior and approach is more tribal in nature, i.e., there's always a sense of community and togetherness.</p><p><strong>You've been part of a band as well and you're a great orator. Are you planning to become a Radio Jockey as well?</strong></p><p>RJs can talk for 5-6 hours continuously whereas I can manage only 20-30 minutes and that is my drawback. I think RJs are very talented and patient to talk for long hours everyday. At music, I have an unfair advantage because <strong>'</strong>Singh<strong>' </strong>is my middle name!</p><p>Every Friday I do a weekend jam on LinkedIn and get a lot of followers for it. It has been a good experience till date. I think music has helped me a lot in my business as well. I come to know how people are changing, how music is changing, and also how listeners are changing. Even though I'm biologically 52 years old, it has kept my mind very young and I am hence able to connect with youngsters.</p><p><strong>What final message or word of advice would you like to offer to the engineering students?</strong></p><p>I think you are lucky in one way and unlucky in another; lucky because you have access to everything quite easily. The best of all information, the best of all people to speak to, and many more things which we never had when we were doing engineering. DTU has great credentials - founders of billion-dollar companies like PayTM, Zomato, PepperFry; all are DCE alumni.</p><p>But unfortunately everything that you have access to, everybody else does too. People have to realise that your access is not unique and actually start working towards creating that edge that people may think you have. A word of praise and at the same time a word of caution.</p>",

Somalia temperature is normal for us.\"</p><p><strong>Any interesting stories that you'd like to share?</strong><br>\"The food here is really spicy and sometimes it is difficult to cope.

We didn’t cover those topics which most of the students here already did in grade twelfth. We had to cope with the added academic burden.\"</p><p><strong>How has Delhi winter been treating you?</strong><br>\"I prefer the winters over the summers in Delhi.\"<br>\"I am used to a maximum temperature of 35°C in the summers. But the temperatures here get so much higher.\"</p><p><strong>Did you attend our recent college fest, Yuvaan? How are fests like these different from the fest at your previous institutions? &nbsp;</strong><br>\"The main difference is that the events mostly use Hindi. However, this is to be expected as it is the main language here.\"</p><p><strong>What are your future goals and how do think studying here helps you achieve them while you live so far away from home?</strong><br>\"People have told us how to cope with the various difficulties we face away from home.<br>We feel like the beginning was bad, and we hope for a better ending. We will be proud on the convocation day.\"<br>\"I <i>hope</i> that we’ll get our degrees.\"</p><p><strong>Any interesting stories that you'd like to share?</strong><br>\"She just loves rickshaws! We don't have that at our place. We also like the Delhi Metro, it is very safe.\"</p><p><strong>Have you toured around Delhi? &nbsp;</strong><br>\"We have toured the Lotus Temple, India Gate, and the Red Fort around Delhi.\"<br>\"We have also explored the food. For us, rice is a staple food. But the combination of <i>daal </i>and <i>rice </i>here is different. Most people are vegetarian here. Back in Mauritius, everyone is non-vegetarian.\"<br>\"The festivals too are worth a mention. We are very multicultural. Here, a majority of celebrations are for Hindu festivals. We have about equal celebrations for festivals of all religions.\"</p><p><strong>Why did you choose DTU specifically over other colleges?</strong><br>\"The Ministry of Education chooses the best institute for us on the basis of our grades in the twelfth standard. We provide them with some of our choices, and then the government chooses for us from between these options.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Interview 3: The students in the following interview are Lucinda Manuel (EE), Mozambique Yúnasse Premugy (SE), Enzo Cossa (COE), Emerson Madiba De Alcides Sebastiao (CE); all from Mozambique.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why did you choose DTU specifically over other colleges and why your specific branches?</strong><br>\"The government gives us three choices under our scholarship. As DTU is among the top colleges in India, it was one of our prime choices.\"<br>\"Since I like electronics, SE appeared to be the right choice for me.\"<br>\"I was doing architecture at my place in back in Mozambique. Civil Engineering felt like the closest to architecture, so I chose this.\"<br>\"Even though DTU is also considered one of the best technological universities in India as he mentioned, it is also in the capital of this country which itself comes with its own perks. I chose Computer Engineering because I have always been amazed by electronics and its circuits and the technology surrounding it. Also, my prime role models which include Steve Jobs and Elon Musk inspired me to pursue this career.\"</p><p><strong>How does the Education system at your place differ from the one here?</strong><br>\"The education system in India is more complex, not only with respect to teaching but also the curriculum. For instance, we started learning matrices as a part of our curriculum. But even though I had studied the basics of matrices back in my country, the way I learned it here is very different even though the topics are the same.\"<br>\"What I have realised after studying here is that Indian students can study a lot in a very small time. When we finish studying one topic, most of our Indian friends are done with about five topics. I find it very fast-pacing. It becomes difficult for us to cope sometimes because it is all part of a huge process for us.\"<br>\"India has great Engineering Institutions, with which they also have great technology. It is a little tough for us to catch up, but eventually, with time, we will get used to it.\"</p><p><strong>How did you find the teaching pattern?</strong><br>\"DTU does have great teachers, and most of them speak Hindi which we don’t understand. An international student could have the same query in class as an Indian student. But then again, Hindi does happen to be their prime language. I don’t blame them for being fluent in it.\"<br>\"Students are supportive and helpful. We have a lot of fun in class.\"</p><p><strong>Did you find any stark cultural differences and how did you find adjusting with them?</strong><br>\"We haven’t visited a lot of historical places. I have only been to the Lotus Temple. Even though it was a great experience, I didn’t like the fact that we weren’t allowed to take pictures.\"<br>\"Mozambique is very different, both in terms of culture and food. We are still getting used to all the changes we have to deal with and it is not as easy for us to have fun like the others. We are still adapting.\"</p><p><strong>What are your future goals and how do think studying here helps you achieve them while you live so far away from home?</strong><br>\"An international curriculum always helps you understand a new culture and new language which is already a bliss. The international education we are getting in India, which has all the technological giants, will definitely help us in our overall development as a person.\"</p><p><strong>Did you attend our recent college fest, Yuvaan? How are fests like these different from the fest at your previous institutions? &nbsp;</strong><br>\"Our overall experience wasn’t as great as the majority of events were in Hindi. We didn't quite understand them; we only attended for the good food.\"<br>\"There are a lot of fests and holidays in India. Fests back in our schools in Mozambique were lesser in number and hence we had lesser holidays.\"</p><p><strong>Any interesting stories that you'd like to share?</strong><br>\"Everything is interesting and we are always open to learning and discussing new things.\"<br>\"Earlier a lot of people would look at us and think we are very different and probably stare at us and ask for pictures. Even though it was weird and intimidating at first, now we just laugh it off and actually try to make conversations with them.\"</p><p><strong>How do you find the food?</strong><br>\"The food here is okay, except it is very spicy and has a lot of masalas. We eat beans and chapati with juice at the Canteen sometimes. Earlier we would spend a lot of our money on KFC food.\"&nbsp;<br>\"But we understand that we’re here for four years and will eventually have to adapt to Indian food and eat it like it is our food.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Interview 4: The students in the following interview are Hamlet Mukuwe (EE, Zambia), Fred Kabwe (ME, Zambia), Gift Mwale (ME, Zambia), Yusuf Ahmed (SE, Nigeria), Muna Kabamba (CE, Zambia), Bruno Adul (IT, Kenya), and Marko Manyang (SE, South Sudan)</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why did you choose DTU specifically, over other colleges?</strong><br>\"One of my friends had suggested DTU to me and since it is ranked right after the IITs, I decided that this would be the best institute for me.\"<br>\"I have always wanted to specialize in IT, and since most of the IT firms including Microsoft employ people from Asia especially from India, I decided that I wanted to study in one of the best technological institute of India.\"<br>\"I joined DTU because it is known for its infrastructure.\"<br>\"I have chosen DTU for three reasons, one of them being the location in the main city which combines a lot of cultures, then I look at the environment, which is really beautiful. The third thing is the ranking, one of the most important things that made me apply here.\"</p><p><strong>How’s has your overall experience been so far?</strong><br>\"My experience here has been great so far, because I have got more than I expected.\"<br>\"The students and our classmates are very social, hence it is easy to interact with them. The professors as well are helpful which makes it easy for us to approach them.\"</p><p><strong>How does the Education system at your place differ from the one here?</strong><br>\"The education system here is more advanced compared to our education system. For example our syllabus structure compared to Indian structure is totally different. It is a challenge when you come to study at a foreign place, but we have adapted now.\"</p><p><strong>How do you like the cold weather?</strong><br>\"Even though it’s very cold, we find it better than the summer. In the beginning it was so hot that even breathing was hard and we felt as if we were suffocating.\"<br>\"The only challenge we face is food. Even though we have found some ways to improvise our food habits, there are still a ton of spicy dishes that we can’t eat.\"<br>\"Another thing that is very problematic is the language barrier. As none of us can speak Hindi, It’s very difficult for us to go somewhere or talk to the locals. For example, if I want to buy milk, and &nbsp;I don’t use the correct term with the correct Hindi accent for milk they wouldn’t understand.\"<br>\"There were some challenges, most explained above, and one of the challenges is the Indian accent. Every kind of announcements that are made in class, even though they are in English have a touch of Indian accent to it, hence none of us can comprehend anything. But now we hope to learn Hindi as soon as possible since we would be here for the next four more vital years of our lives, with some of our classmates helping us.\"</p><p><strong>Did you attend our recent college fest, Yuvaan? How are fests like these different from the fest at your previous institutions?</strong><br>\"Since most of the events were in Hindi we couldn’t understand while most of our friends were having a great time. I went there wondering if I would understand the activities happening over there. I couldn’t get someone to orient me regarding what was taking place. After some students attended it, they explained to me how the fests unfold. I definitely won't miss Engifest now.\"</p><p><strong>What are your future goals and how do you think DTU will help in achieving them?</strong><br>\"To graduate as someone who is successful not only on paper, but also in practice. So far we’re doing the practicals in the labs and studying the theory in the lectures. The practicals are what we learn in class, so it is compatible.\"<br>\"Regarding the future, you can pass with a very good result but have an empty experience. So despite the teaching, if we are not doing something worthwhile apart from what we are being taught, we can end up just getting a degree without experience. So we need to focus on getting a degree as well as experience.\"</p><p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share?</strong><br>\"I want that by 2022 when I pass out from DTU I will be an all-rounder person. Someone who can fit into society, socially and spiritually. I want to become an entrepreneur or someone with influence. For example, if students are allowed to participate in politics, do we have campus politics in DTU?\"<br>\"If we could participate and take some of the positions with regards to foreign students, maybe have a special board, we can help with the growing community. We don’t have a formal platform yet.\"<br>\"I feel that the issue is that we have a lot of students who are very clever, but people seem to be keep things to themselves - I may know something and I keep it for myself. But if we share ideas within the university, DTU will can go far. But students are so egocentric that they just don’t want to share ideas, and if we are not sharing ideas then we cannot push the University to where it’s supposed to be. And the students are not challenging anything that is written in the books they, they just assume its right. We should make them more inquisitive as whatever was written in the books, was written by humans and can have mistakes.\"<br>\"I think that as international students, we too need to be part of DTU Student Association. We get to know about&nbsp;most of the things going on in the college months after. We need some form of representation in the Student Association, someone who is fully equipped with the information on what is going on so that they too can participate. Let's take Engifest for instance, most of us are not doing anything. Even though we can show our talent, we don't have as many platforms to showcase.\"<br>\"I think that’s something the administration can do, providing us a platform where we can share our ideas and they can address our issues.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Through achieving all this, I wish to give the women in my family a good life.</p><p><strong>How has your overall experience been?</strong></p><p>Studying in a foreign country leaves us a lot of things to explore, not just in terms of academics.</p><p><strong>How has Delhi winter been treating you?</strong></p><p>Delhi Winter makes it difficult to get out of our rooms. We mostly end up missing our morning classes. Also, summer is also very hot, and we are left sweating. Somalia temperature is normal for us. We are still adapting to this climate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any interesting stories that you'd like to share?</strong></p><p>The food here is really spicy and sometimes it is difficult to cope. We have <i>survived </i>on bananas for around 2 weeks during the beginning of the year.<i> </i>Even then, all of us really love <i>Chicken fried rice </i>and we can perhaps call ourselves semi-Indians.</p>",

The festival began with a formal inauguration ceremony attended by Hon’ble Vice Chancellor Prof. Yogesh Singh, followed by a Kavi Sammelan. More than fifty cultural events were organised over the three days by the numerous university societies, which saw participation from universities all over Delhi and northern India. The university was seen buzzing with excitement around the clock as several events, formal and informal, were organised at all the hotspots of campus and along the periphery of the OAT, including Food City, photo booths, karaoke, zorbing, ziplining and beach volleyball. A YouTube Fan Fiesta was also organised that witnessed twelve popular YouTubers interacting with the crowd at the OAT. Tie-ups with foreign embassies including Israel and Ukraine saw talented foreign artists entertaining the gathering with their performances in the International Fiesta. The Humor Fest included stand-up acts by the likes of Nishant Tanwar and Rahul Dua over the course of three days. The main attractions on the first day of the fest were the Bollywood music composers Vishal Dadlani and Shekhar Ravjiani performing live to a jam-packed concert ground in LiveWire. The second evening saw Punjabi music industry artist Mankirt Aulakh perform his chartbusters to a boisterous crowd. The three-day extravaganza ended on a high note as the crowd grooved to the beats of international EDM artist DJ Quintino on the final evening of Engifest 2019.</p>",

    "body": "<h4><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Jahnvi Singh, Electrical and Electronics Engineering who secured a placement as a Junior Analyst-Investment Banking at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</strong></i></h4><p><strong>How have the placements for your branch been this year? Please share the highlights of the placements season so far.</strong></p><p>The placement season has gone pretty well for my branch this year.&nbsp;<br>In <strong>core electronics domain</strong>, students have bagged offers from companies like <strong>Texas Instruments, Sandisk, NXP Semiconductors</strong> etc.&nbsp;<br>For<strong> electrical domain</strong>, companies like <strong>Tata Power, Nestle </strong>and some PSUs like <strong>GAIL </strong>visited the campus.&nbsp;<br>In <strong>non-technical domain </strong>too, there have been plenty of opportunities with students getting placed in companies like <strong>Bain Capability Centre, Boston Consulting Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What did you give more weightage to – The Profile Offered or the Company Reputation?</strong></p><p>I think both of these things play a role. Company reputation plays a major role in determining your career ahead and the kind of opportunities that you will get in future. At the same time, you should try to look for roles of your interest and consider the kind of things that you will learn by the particular kind of work and how it will help you in achieving you goals.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, it was quite clear that I had to apply for JP Morgan since it is <strong>one of the biggest investment banks in the world</strong> and I have had an interest in finance for a very long time. So the role offered aligned with my career goals.</p><p><strong>Why did you select the particular profile and what parameters did you consider before making your choice?</strong></p><p>As I mentioned, I had a deep interest in finance for a very long time and I had done some courses and internships in this particular domain. The main reason for choosing the profile of <strong>Junior Analyst at JP Morgan</strong> was my interest and also the fact that the work over there would enhance my market knowledge and would provide me with a very good platform to start my career.&nbsp;<br>I researched about the company, its <strong>work culture </strong>and the kind of opportunities that it provides to its employees and I was quite impressed. These all factors motivated me further to give it my best shot.</p><p><strong>What were the type of Selection Tests (Rounds)?</strong></p><p>The cutoff for JP Morgan was <strong>zero</strong> and it was <strong>open for all branches.</strong> There was no other requirement. Following were the selection rounds:</p><p>1.<strong> CV shortlisting </strong><i>(Considering your CGPA and relevant work experience)</i><br>2. <strong>Written Test-1</strong> <i>(Questions from quantitative aptitude, finance, economics and market awareness)</i><br>3.<strong> PPT and Workshop </strong><i>(It was an interactive round and people were being marked according to the answers that they gave and how responsive they were)</i><br>4. <strong>Written Test 2 </strong><i>(Questions from basic accounting, income statements and financial ratios)</i><br>5. <strong>Technical Interview </strong><i>(Finance)</i><br>6. <strong>HR Interview&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>How did you prepare for the selection tests?</strong></p><p>The finance courses that I had taken, made sure that my basics were clear. There are plenty of them available for free on websites like <strong>Udemy and Coursera. </strong>Apart from that I referred to few <strong>NSE Academy books</strong> and <strong>Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking.</strong>&nbsp;<br>I watched <strong>financial modelling</strong> and how to prepare <strong>financial statements tutorials</strong> from the internet. The key to cracking the test is to be crystal clear with your basics since in finance, if you just read to mug it up, you will get confused in the test.&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Make sure that you understand all the keywords, financial statements and ratios properly.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>Could you offer some tips to ace the interview round?</strong></p><p>The first thing that I would like to share is that before going to any interview, research thoroughly about the company that you are applying for and the role that they are offering. You should know things like the <strong>company's CEO, its headquarters,</strong> which <strong>domains </strong>it works in, any recent news that it was involved in etc.&nbsp;<br>Secondly, if you are applying for a finance company, then you should be aware of all the <strong>market trends</strong> in past one year. This would give you an edge over other candidates in the interview.&nbsp;<br>Lastly, you should be confident and believe in yourself.</p><p><strong>Any advice you would like to give to the junior students?</strong><br><br>Estimate your potential and start preparing for the placement season according to that. Be clear about your short term and long term goals and apply to companies accordingly. There will be ample of opportunities, it's just a matter of who uses it well.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Prof. Dharendra Yogi Goswami, who was the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony of Invictus 2019.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Can you please tell us more about your journal which focuses on Solar Energy and Heat Transfer?</strong></p><p>This journal is the oldest in its field, and I think it is the most prestigious too, I tend to be biased towards it as I am the Editor-In-Chief! But, it is a comprehensive journal which covers many areas that include Solar Resources, Solar Radiation prediction and its modeling for large and small scale use, Solar-Thermal applications like desalination, High Temperature Solar Applications i.e. concentrating solar power to produce fuels like hydrogen, and Photovoltaics. These areas then have many sub-areas which the journal also covers.</p><p>Due to the vastness of this journal, I, as the Chief, cannot know everything, so I have team of editors around the world who help me, one in Solar Resources and Meteorology, one in Solar-Thermal Applications, one in Photovoltaics and one in Concentrating Solar Power, and acting under them are 56 other Associate Editors who have done years and years of research and are known as ’experts’ their respective fields. What is published in the journal is results of research that people will hear only about 10 years from their time, because for a research to be applied in a product is time consuming. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Even though your prime focus remains Solar Energy, are you considering other forms of energy that which may provide the same advantages?</strong></p><p>Solar energy is the direct energy that comes from the sun, there are other forms of solar energy which are indirect like Biomass - to produce biofuels, Ocean Energy, Wind Energy and my interest lies in Renewable Energy, the forms of energy which will not be exhausted and will be renewed by nature. My research is in Solar Energy, but my interest lies in the field of Renewable Energy.</p><p><strong>What betterment in Solar Energy can be made to make it more efficient?</strong></p><p>Be it Nuclear Energy, energy from Fossil Fuels, or Solar Energy; if we are converting it to heat and then to power, it is done by a thermodynamic cycle, and in a thermodynamic cycle, a part of the heat needs to be rejected and hence the efficiency of the process is anywhere from 10-15 percent to at most 50-55 percent. The remainder energy is rejected in to the environment. We are looking into ways where that rejected energy can also be utilized. I developed a thermodynamic cycle which is known as the Goswami Cycle, where the energy that is dissipated is utilized to give some other output for example, it can be used for desalination i.e. converting the sea water to fresh water, as the temperature required to do so is very low. In my cycle we use it to produce cooling.</p><p>After I developed this cycle, people started to look into other possible outputs that can be obtained from the dissipated energy. This is when you convert sunlight to heat and then heat to power, but that is not the only way to convert sunlight into power. There is another method of conversion that is known as Photovoltaics i.e. the direct conversion of sunlight to power and its limitation comes with the bandgap of the material. All the Photovoltaic Panels that are available on the market have an efficiency of 22 percent, whereas the panels that have been developed in labs have an efficiency of over forty percent. The third way of conversion is by using the wave nature of light, with the help of nano-scale antennas. The theoretical efficiency in this method is around 80 percent. So, the efficiency is only increasing. Even in the thermal processes, the energy which was supposed to be rejected can now be utilized with the advancements in research. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We would like to know more about the incident that pushed you to work in the field of Solar Energy and how important the motive for the researchers to enter that field is.</strong></p><p>During my there were many areas that were considered very important, and I could have gone into any of those. But, just because of the oil embargoes imposed by the Arab countries, there was a shortage of Petrol or Gasoline in the western countries. There would be huge lines for buying gas for the vehicles. Upon seeing this, I thought to myself if oil was the future source. It led to a chain of thought, ‘Oil comes from the ground, it will end eventually’, in fact if the rate of consumption of oil and natural gas remains the same, it will be exhausted within forty to fifty years. Whereas coal may last for over hundred years. As the time was limited, I started to think of the future sources of energy, and indulged myself with the knowledge of Solar Energy.</p><p>If you have the motivation, and a certain reason to pursue, you become passionate, once you become passionate, you will achieve something big.</p><p><strong>What role has DCE played in all that you’ve achieved?</strong></p><p>Your first college is where you learn a lot. That is where your basic development takes place. In that respect, DTU or its predecessor DCE, has played a very important role in my life. Not just the education part, but the camaraderie of all the classmates, who were also among the best in the country, as well as the faculty members who guided us. All of that had a tremendous impact on how I developed.</p><p><strong>You spend most of your time in the US. How do you think India has changed since then?</strong></p><p>There are many welcome changes in India. We’ve moved into the new century, and there’s progress all over. At the same time, India has not kept pace with some of the other countries of the world. For example, around year 2000, India and China were considered to be equal, and yet China has moved so far ahead of India. I don’t know where to put the blame for this, but there is definitely some blame to go around. We need to now start thinking as to how India can take its rightful place in the world in terms of technology, in terms of development, in terms of opportunities for the young people. I met with Prime Minister Modi in September, and I’m very happy to know that he has that vision that he wants India to be not even equal to China but be ahead of China, be among the two or three countries in the world that are the topmost countries. That’s the kind of vision we need, and we also need an action plan to achieve that vision.</p><p><strong>Would you like to give any message to our readers?</strong></p><p>Firstly, I feel very optimistic seeing the students today, it is nothing like the old times, students are more active given various situations. Students need to take up the entrepreneurship spirit and create jobs for others. Even if five percent of the students do so, they will create jobs for the rest of them!</p><p>When I graduated, it was a very small college, although very prestigious in India. There were only 3 departments: Mechanical, Electrical and Civil. The enrollment was fixed: 80 in Mechanical, 80 in Electrical, 40 in Civil, so only 200 students in one batch. It was highly, highly competitive. But now, we have many departments, which is good, and it is a university, so it’s not just an engineering college anymore. Although engineering is still the dominant part, it has other areas also.</p><p>Another change is that when we were young, we were missing one thing: almost all of the students were boys. Now you have a mix, which makes life more interesting, because if it’s just a men’s college or just a women’s college, life is not that interesting.</p><p>The other thing I like about DTU now is that the university has kept its standards and it is still among the best in the country.</p>",

I do a thorough background check of every entrepreneur who pitches to me. If one claims to have implemented Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, then it must not be that he/she has just done some course on the same and that is it. You need to get your hands dirty in it to be able to claim such a thing. This is the background check I perform.</p><p><strong>The past decade has seen a huge number of companies working in the same domain. What, according to you, differentiates a company in this big pool of competition?</strong></p><p>Ideas cannot be stolen, Two people can have the same idea, but what inspired and motivated them to reach there is always unique.</p><p>The thing that makes you stand apart is the Customer Feedback. If your customers are willing to pay you, then obviously you have it all sorted out. Read books and learn how to stand out. There a number of books available, if you don’t understand the first one, read the next. This will help you see your potential and you can then use it in the right direction.</p><p><strong>What message would you like to offer to the young entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>It’s a great time to be a young person in India. The whole world is changing, India is definitely on a growth trajectory. You guys are young, you have the time and you’re privileged. Play to your strengths and don’t compare yourself to people around you.</p><p>I would say you actually have the right to win in Tier-III cities. Someone sitting in Stanford doesn’t have the access to such a growing market. Your market here is big enough for you start a million-dollar company.</p>",

I do a thorough background check of every entrepreneur who pitches to me. If one claims to have implemented Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, then it must not be that he/she has just done some course on the same and that’s it. You need to get your hands dirty in it to be able to claim such a thing. This is the background check I perform.</p><p><strong>The past decade has seen a huge number of companies working in the same domain. What, according to you, differentiates a company in this big pool of competition?</strong></p><p>Ideas cannot be stolen, Two people can have the same idea, but what inspired and motivated them to reach there is always unique.</p><p>The thing that makes you stand apart is the Customer Feedback. If your customers are willing to pay you, then obviously you have it all sorted out. Read books and learn how to stand out. There a number of books available, if you don’t understand the first one, read the next. This will help you see your potential and you can then use it in the right direction.</p><p><strong>What message would you like to offer to the young entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>It’s a great time to be a young person in India. The whole world is changing, India is definitely on a growth trajectory. You guys are young, you have the time and you’re privileged. Play to your strengths and don’t compare yourself to people around you.</p><p>I would say you actually have the right to win in Tier-III cities. Someone sitting in Stanford doesn’t have the access to such a growing market. Your market here is big enough for you to start a million-dollar company.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed popular actress and YouTuber Shreya Mehta, who was in DTU for a talk session in SPAC'19, organised by Invictus, DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What made you pursue acting as a career?</strong></p><p>When I was fourteen, I realised that I wanted to take up acting as my career. Even then, people in their forties often don't realise their true call. But I watched <i>Jab We Met</i> and it made me so happy that it changed my life. And that was when I realised that I wanted to act and perform for people and make them happy. I would like to believe that I was blessed.</p><p><strong>Most people adopt a very classical career path based on whatever occupations surround them, mostly because they don’t realise their true call. What would you say about this, considering your career path is very unconventional?</strong></p><p>Every person is on their own journey. Deep inside, they know what they want to pursue. Sometimes, they don’t end up doing it because of various pressures. But even after they realise their true call, they end up neglecting it and instead do what their heart doesn’t tell them to do. I strongly don't believe in that and I am happy to be doing something that I absolutely love doing!</p><p><strong>Apart from being a part of a lot of YouTube videos, you are also a Motivational Speaker. How did you decide on balancing both of these jobs together?</strong></p><p>I never specifically decided on becoming a motivational speaker, I just believe that I have a positive vibe inside me. I have also had a lot of bitter personal experiences and have been through a lot of ups and down early in my life which have only made me mature. I have accepted all my flaws. I consider myself to be a strong woman, having dealt with a lot of emotional and mental pressure, I have now become a very positive person. When I see people being negative about themselves I realise that I need to spread my positive energy and I try my level best to do whatever positive comes to my mind for the audience I have. As you mature, you grow into this confident individual who doesn’t care about non-important stuff. I hence share my stories and my perception about life and they like it as well.</p><p><strong>What are the pros and cons of being in front of the camera at all times, whether you are shooting or not?</strong></p><p>I absolutely love it! This is all I have ever wanted, and I am doing it. I am aware of what I do and its consequences. I am an attention-seeker and that is primarily why I act -- because I seek all the love of people even while I am not acting or when I am with my fans. Hence there is nothing negative.</p><p><strong>Do you have any message for anyone who is realising their true call and on their way to pursue their passion?</strong></p><p>Never ignore your inner voice. Whatever your heart says is the most important thing and you shouldn’t neglect it. Live for yourself. There’s no point in being alive unless you’re happy!</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Paritosh Sharma, Founder, Sava100Crore and Consulting VP (Growth/Marketing), who was in DTU for a talk session in SPAC '19, organised by IEEE DTU under Invictus 2019.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How exactly did you come up with the term Sava100Crore for your company?</strong></p><p>I would say the fundamental inspiration was from our Prime Minister. He uses this term often. I thought that most Indians, irrespective of language barriers, would connect and engage with it and hence we ended up adopting this.</p><p><strong>You talked about how the Internet is the cheapest business tool these days. What are the other business tools that are accommodated on the internet itself?</strong></p><p>There are tons of such tools that the Internet incorporates, videos being one of the most important ones. They use both audio and visual aids and help to reach out to a lot of people. It depends mostly on the requirements of the business, for example, if it is a small business, there are a lot of <i>SaaS</i>-based options. Every company, starting from <i>Google</i> to <i>Zoho</i> to <i>Freshworks </i>is<i> </i>providing all sorts of assistance that help other companies develop themselves. I feel that technology solves all the problems out there, it just depends on what stage of business and requirement fits the company. Even newsletters and email-marketing, which are majorly untapped, could be utilised to serve our needs. The most important tool, however, is always content. If you tell great stories, people will come to you.</p><p><strong>How does Sava100Crore help in establishing a business globally?</strong></p><p>It is a fairly simple process. I introduce the customers to the companies on my channel, and then we put out videos on a quarterly basis. None of these videos are market-driven, but instead we try to be genuine and tell people why we transact money with them. This is how we create stories, and this also helps us in conveying our vision to our customers. When you are a small business, a lot depends on the individual conducting the trade. They trust the individual and his vision. The story behind the business becomes more important than the business itself. Our videos are seen everywhere from Canada to Australia and help to put such individualistic companies on the map. Most of our audience is Indian, with almost 65% of our audience being male, and the rest 35% being female.</p><p><strong>Why do you think there is such a wide discrepancy in the gender ratio?</strong></p><p>Females somehow started coming to our channel just two months ago. I think female entrepreneurship is on the rise, especially in India. We have started curating our content in a way that it does not become solely male-dominated, and such that even my mother would like to see and connect with it. Just around 3 months back, I did a story on <i>Freshworks</i>, and my mother asked me what <i>SaaS</i> was. Somehow, my mother, who has always been a housewife, asking me this made me feel like we were changing the social fabric and culture of this country. All of the hard work that we at Sava100Crore do is targeted to influence the very social structure of our society.</p><p><strong>Do you have any content which is specific to only a certain kind of audience?</strong></p><p>No, all our content is designed in a way that it reaches out to everyone. Any Indian around the world can watch it and understand how so many entrepreneurs are doing so many amazing things.</p><p><strong>Since you have interacted with a lot of small businesses and seen them grow as well, what are the key points which the businesses have to keep in mind before starting out?</strong></p><p>I have realized there are 3 things fundamentally: persistence because it gets really tough in the middle and you can lose your game; a grand vision which helps you solve problems that you encounter; and honesty with yourself, your business, and your clients. If you are not honest and are doing things simply for the sake of making money, it won’t work out for you. If you get these three things together, the rest will just fall in place.</p><p><strong>How do you think engineering students can help in curating more ideas in such businesses?</strong></p><p>I think they have a huge part to play in the growth of this sector. As engineering students, in terms of hardware, software and even design, all of you can be the most powerful from the point of knowledge and consulting. In fact, each one of you could start reaching out to small businesses and help them grow faster.</p>",

The attack was met with remorse and anger, as the Indian Government led a global effort to create pressure on Pakistan to act on the terrorist organisations it hosts. On 26 February, the Indian Air Force carried out preemptive strikes on JeM facilities in Balakot, Pakistan. This was followed by a retaliatory attempt from the PAF on 27 February, in which an aerial combat ensued on the border.

The attack was met with remorse and anger, as the Indian Government led a global effort to create pressure on Pakistan to act on the terrorist organisations it hosts. On 26 February, the Indian Air Force carried out preemptive strikes on JeM facilities in Balakot, Pakistan. This was followed by a retaliatory attempt from the PAF on 27 February, in which an aerial combat ensued on the border. The result of the aerial combat was borne heavily by the Indian Air Force as Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman’s fighter jet took heavy damage, after which he ejected his jet and descended near a village in Pakistan.</p><p>For the people of India, the knowledge and sight of an Indian officer held captive in foreign territory was no less enlightening than heartening. Even for citizens who had been warmongering for the greater part of two weeks, the sight brought home the horrors of war. It is never armchair strategists or supposed studio experts that suffer the travails of unrest at our borders- it is the forces and their families. India’s defence is, and has always been, its last bastion, never its first preference.</p><p>Over the next sixty hours, as various videos surfaced of Wg Cdr Abhinandan under captivity, the world stood to marvel at his composure in the face of endless adverse possibilities. His percipient understanding of what one’s captors were and weren’t to be informed about stood to testify for the professionalism of our officers; his acknowledgement of the enemy forces he had been up in arms against not long ago stood for his own rectitude.</p><p>In more ways than one, the equanimity and conscientiousness exhibited by Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman exemplifies the spirit of New India- an India not afraid to demand her rights and refusing to retreat on her values and ideals. The return of Wg Cdr Abhinandan is a lesson in discipline, restraint and the pride of being Indian, even as it reinforces the incumbency on each citizen to remember that it is the forces that fight the war, not we.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Diwakar Vaish, Head of Robotics and Research at A-SET Training and Research Institutes, who was in DTU for the Humanoid Robot Show organised by IEEE-DTU under Invictus 2019.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How did you get attracted to the field of robotics?</strong></p><p>Everyone is interested in robotics. As a child, back in the 1990s, I had developed a genuine interest in robots. Everyone had an interest, so did I. The only difference between me and everyone else was that I was trying to curate and to find a way to turn this interest into reality! I remember, back when I was in the fifth standard, I started doing courses in Electronics, and trying to understand how things are actually made. This really got my attention and I realised that I was loving this!</p><p>I started going to multiple inter-school competitions and understood how the world thinks of robots; how others such as my friends and teachers thought of it. After that, the internet came in when I was in the seventh or eighth standard. I started googling things, collecting and gathering my resources for which I needed money. I used to ask my mother for financial help and she would give it willingly, after seeing my interest and achievements in this field. They always thought that it would be good for me. So, when I programmed my first robot, it was a huge success for my parents and I. It was an amazing journey from programming my first robot to where I am right now. Nine years have passed since then.</p><p><strong>Just like you said, ‘Everyone is interested in robotics’, but not everyone makes it their field of research or study or chooses a profession in that field. What are your views on this?</strong></p><p>Not everyone has the same perspective as me towards robotics. They may have that perspective towards something else. It might also be even closely related to technology, i.e., it may be about cooking or photography. Everyone has different interests. One should definitely go and explore their interest. The major problem is that they are scared! Sometimes, the people and the circumstances around us tend to strangle us into a sphere. We are conditioned to believe that there are very few specific paths to success which we are pushed to take.</p><p>Here in India, with a population of 1.30 billion, we do have many problems. We also have many people who suffer and are ready to pay to get their problems solved. We are not able to think beyond that.</p><p>You can take risks. Go ahead and don’t be scared. If you fail, there is no problem in joining an MNC at 29. So, I would like to say that you must go ahead to take risks in your life and explore your interests. What other time would be best for you to explore your interest? It's your college life! After you turn 30, you won't be able to explore your interests the way you can now. The number of risks involved will be more then!</p><p><strong>&nbsp;What do you think is the future of humanoid robots?</strong></p><p>Humanoid robots are amazing and highly efficient. The way they do and learn things is amazing. &nbsp;We have seen them do backflips and cartwheels. They are able to fight a fire and they can use water and make a sprinkler fountain out of it, they can climb small hills or mountains. We have seen different kinds of humanoid robots excel in various fields. The truth is that more people are required to research on them.</p><p>Making more robots will certainly accelerate the research. The power source also creates another problem. As soon as we have proper and efficient power sources, which can store large amounts of memory with lighter equipment, it would bring them closer to the world of humanoids. Inevitably, it has to happen.</p><p><strong>The robots are designed on the basis of the AI and ML fields. This gives them thinking abilities which might someday match that of a human. In the case of the Sophia robot, it had spoken of some controversial statements and so was shut down. What are your views on this?</strong></p><p>For this, we need to think of robots as a different species and not as an ordinary machine. To think of it, we are at some level similar to robots but we have developed thinking abilities and creativity which sets us apart from them. So, robots as a species can be good or bad depending on the way the user programs it.</p><p>Machine learning algorithms and artificial Intelligence concepts are at a very nascent stage and are being heavily researched upon. It will take a lot of time to broaden the AI and ML concepts so as to allow that to happen.</p><p>The learning curve of AI and ML starts with the learning of an ant and then to that of a rat and then a dog and so on. It also takes a lot of time to grow from one level of intelligence to another. We have developed to the stage of acquiring the intelligence of a chimpanzee, but we have a lot more to go. As soon as we reach the stage of acquiring and incorporating human-level intelligence into a robot, it will change the world.</p><p><strong>How do you think learning AI and ML during college life is helpful for any field in robotics?</strong></p><p>Not everyone needs to learn AI and ML. If you are learning AI and ML you need to try and incorporate these elements into your life. If you don’t apply them after learning, then it is just a waste of time and there is no use to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Sam Baisla, Founder and CEO of Brand Samosa, who was a keynote speaker at the Student Professional Awareness Conference (SPAC) under Invictus 2019.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Do you think digital marketing and bigger corporate markets are different from smaller markets?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, the way it’s different is very niche. If you're a small business and you're providing services in a locality, you should only focus on that locality. For example, if you own a salon and you want to become the next VLCC or the next Jawed Habib, you have an outlet for the customers who come from nearby.</p><p>So, you should not be advertising in the Times of India as it takes a lot of money and there's no guarantee people will look at it too. If you do something like pamphlets, there's no point as they are slowly going out of fashion. Investing in billboards, banners or hoardings becomes very tricky. You have to target the people in your locality on Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter. It's cost-effective, it's easy and you can do it in real time.</p><p>Bigger corporations work differently. They invest a lot in their branding and they reap those benefits in 10 years. For small businesses, it’s more real-time regeneration; spend money, get people, and close the deal. So it's different, empowering, and more effective. That's what we are trying to do at Brand Samosa.</p><p><strong>Since your company is based in many places out of India, how is Digital Marketing different in other countries?</strong></p><p>So, the most important thing I share here is: there are two sides of social media, one is the consumer side; wherein you make them watch the videos you make, and the other side is content creation; wherein you’re creating that content. The US, among the other countries, is on the creation side while India is majorly on the consuming side.</p><p>We have lots of users online, and if you can be that guy who creates content for all those users you end up making a lot of money. The best part is it's very cheap in India. For the same click on a YouTube video, you pay $1 in the US while in India you pay like 10 cents. On a $100 budget, you can do a lot of things on social media. I just recently started hiring for my company, and if I go to a consulting company they charge about 1 month of the salary which is about 8%. I ran a Facebook campaign and received 350 leads. We hired 10 of them. It cost me around $70 which is around ₹5000, i.e., 10 people on average cost me ₹500. All of that happened in a span of ten days. But, if I had to do that in America, I would have to pay more than ₹20000. This is an advantage that many don't realise, it's very cheap!</p><p><strong>A lot of small businesses are coming up. How do you think these small businesses can cope up with others in a way to build competition?</strong></p><p>I think it’s the other way around. Social media- what it has done is that you can completely focus on your market and you will not be in competition with anyone else. For example one of the startups which your incubation has is building something very similar to Airbnb or OYO, but they’re targeting the long term rental, similar to PGs. If the internet was not there, they would've never done that, and with this small difference, they can just expand it across the country. The internet gives them that capacity. Here either OYO or Airbnb is not giving them competition. They have their own market. You can do the same thing with a company based out of a small city.</p><p><strong>How do you think new entrepreneurs can start their businesses?</strong></p><p>The way entrepreneurship has been portrayed in this country is very disruptive. The whole idea of having a big idea and changing the world very disruptive. I suggest people go the other way around. Don't try to change the world in the beginning. Ask yourself about the skills do you have and the causes are you passionate about. Then ask another simple question- using your skills, can you solve a small problem around you? Once you’re able to do that using your skills, then you can ask yourself, “How many people are there in the world who have similar problems?”</p><p>Everything in the history of entrepreneurship started small. Apple wanted to build something better for themselves, Google wanted to build a better search engine for themselves, Henry Ford wanted to build a better car for himself, this is how it happens. Over a period of time, they become big. It's not that you launch something so amazing that grabs the attention of the entire world. I often use an analogy, “If life gives you lemons, stop crying about oranges, make lemon juice. If the lemons are dry, make lemon scrub.”</p><p><strong>Do you have any final message you'd like to give engineering students?</strong></p><p>When you’re an engineer, and all you're passionate about is technology, you want to build the best product using the best technology, and fall in love with it. Engineers need to learn the business administration processes; the hiring, the sales, and marketing. Because being good at technology and engineering is not enough to run a business, you need other things too. Search for people from different colleges, because you need people who complement your ideas. That is what business needs. If everyone is an engineer, then who will sell it?</p><p>Many would complain “Our thinking doesn't match”, but that's precisely what you need! Since that person will keep you in balance. Otherwise, you'll fall in love with your idea and go crazy trying to handle the business aspects. That person comes with an outside perspective. A change of perspective is extremely important for analysing problems, in the end, this change of perspective is what makes a business grow exponentially. &nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Sanjay Bhargava, Chairman, Bharosa Club, and Mrs. Anita Bhargava, Co-Founder, Bharosa Club, who played a pivotal role in creating PayPal.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>At the age of 42, you were one of the founding members of PayPal. What was the driving force that made you enter the area believed to be dominated by youngsters?</strong></p><p>SB: Around 1999, not only youngsters were getting into dot-com companies. I had been working at Citibank for a very long time, and I had come up with this idea where e-mail could be used to make payments and I wanted to pursue this idea. I was also watching the Internet and learning how the Internet could be quite useful. I thought that I would spend the next 3 years understanding the Internet and work on my idea.</p><p>My work routine was getting monotonous and I knew I needed to experiment. Even if it failed, I could go back to a corporate career. I also knew that if I didn’t try I would regret it throughout my life because I was very passionate. Even though it was a big risk I knew I had a fall-back plan.</p><p>If you look at PayPal’s success story, it involves a combination of people who are all passionate; it is not a one-man show.</p><p><strong>Both of you have extraordinary educational credentials. What role do you think that education from a premium institution plays in long run?</strong></p><p>AB: I feel it does not play any role in today’s day and age. It is what you learn and what you know rather than the institution you went to. If a student going to university, and still gets onto<i> Coursera</i> and does a course on Machine Learning - since the student did it out of passion, that knowledge becomes invaluable.</p><p>SB: If you are cut out to be an entrepreneur, then college education will provide you with little or no help. But if you get into a consultancy career then it could matter because it opens up certain roles.</p><p>AB: At PayPal, I learnt on the job, and it was amazing. My prior education did not help very much because I had a Diploma. One should do whatever they are doing with passion or you will start to dislike your days. Obsessing over solving problems and being passionate towards it will help you in the long run.</p><p>SB: Not everyone can take the route of startups. I had a great time at IIM Ahmedabad and it has helped me grow. The bottom line is, there are numerous options and you do not need to start a company to be successful and earn money, you can join a company too. I didn't start PayPal, I joined PayPal. I was an early bird employee and a member of the founding team. The success I achieved by doing this was quite immense and more than somebody who would found a company.</p><p><strong>“It’s good to be different, but also, it is different to be good”. What is your perspective on this?</strong></p><p>SB: You can divide entrepreneurship into many, many areas. If you open one <i>paan </i>shop, that also counts as entrepreneurship. If you open a thousand <i>paan </i>shops and make <i>paan</i> the favourite food across the world, that is also entrepreneurship. If you want to be different and have an idea that can change the world, pursue it.</p><p>However, just being different for the sake of being different doesn’t help you much. In Bhagvad Gita, there is a famous saying, “keep doing your karma and do not worry about the fruit (of your labour).” But a lot many people misinterpret this. This is incorrect. It actually implies that you should be doing what you are doing, and the outcomes will happen if you are doing things correctly while having faith in yourself. One of the messages which are displayed on the website of Bharosa, which I firmly believe in is, “you can make billions by serving millions”.</p><p>During the 2008 Recession, the US could have turned out much worse, had companies like PayPal and eBay not existed. All the changes that have been happening in technology, such as Platform Revolution, are giving huge opportunities. Around 20 years from now, the Platform Revolution will begin. It will be bigger and will spread faster than the Internet revolution. Paypal took 20 years to become a $100 billion market cap company. I think the companies that you have not heard of today, will become a $100 billion company within the next 10 years, because of the Platform Revolution. This will affect everything, from agriculture and cities to healthcare.</p><p><strong>Any final message that you would like to give to the students?</strong></p><p>SB: There was a popular slogan of the original struggle, ‘Swaraj is my birthright’. Now the students should exclaim, ‘Prosperity is my birthright’ and prosperity doesn’t just imply wealth, it is also contentment and health. The thing is, the students must demand prosperity.</p><p>AB: &nbsp;The youth in general, because they are so tech-savvy, should demand outcomes for making the nation prosperous. Prosperity means good sanitation, eradication of poverty, clean air, etc. In short, demand real outcomes. You need a plan and subsequently, its execution.</p><p>SB: Use the power of technology. There are people who form a core team. They are nameless and faceless. They are doing it just because they are passionate. Once the drive is there, then they do anything like create a vote bank, which is bigger than any other vote bank. Consider Delhi itself for example. Look at the pollution and the slums in Delhi versus its potential for creating jobs, or tourism. Why is this not being utilised? If everybody starts demanding prosperity, then no doubt, India’s GDP will touch $5 trillion soon. But more importantly, every single household in India will be prosperous. They will have adequate wealth. They will be knowledgeable and concerned about health.</p><p>Summing up, I will say that everybody, especially the youth should contemplate that If India does not become prosperous, it is going to be a real problem for us Indians. If it does, it will become the heaven on Earth, just like Rabindranath Tagore envisioned. India can become prosperous, and you have to make it prosperous. I will quote John F Kennedy, who said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Or worse – how ordinarily do you comfort yourself in the bliss of the ignorance that lies at the milepost of every question that revolves around <i>you</i>?</p><p>The common notion of doubt comes from people of various ages, communities, and breeds – opinionated or non-opinionated, telling you to not doubt yourself because it is a testimony to a <i>frail footing</i>. Doubt is often believed to prognosticate the non-fulfillment of the success that you could have had, had you not doubted. More often than not, it is considered to be a cause of ruination and stagnation.</p><p>Customarily, it drives us to the unknown, which is conclusive and categorical. The vastness of this unknown can be calculated only once you doubt the existence of it. The unknown should not be confused with ignorance. Doubting helps drive away <i>conscientious stupidity </i>and<i> sincere ignorance</i> which curbs the possibility of new things materialising. The power of doubt is based on how it tricks our senses to question their validity and augment its oddity to help us grow and develop from within.</p><p>The power of doubt also lies deep in the re-establishment of faith and lets one have a better understanding of oneself, though, blind faith in your correctness can often make you complacent about the purpose you had planned to adhere to. It lulls you back into your zone, oftentimes, restricted to old perspectives and explored paths. Unreasoned belief, often paralytic, can be fixed by doubting the possibility of new ideas and hence, setting a new basis for your actions.</p><p>The birth of new Ideas arises from doubting the already existing working principles that control the outlook of your preconscious. Doubts occupy a small space in the psyche that wonders about the consequences of your actions or provides new ideas to embellish the circumstances. It helps you construct, grow and learn by fighting negatives through discussion of the possibility of their existence.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the Power of Doubt!</p>",

We have applauded our ability to ask intelligent questions. Heck, we have made a profession out of it (read: Journalism). But we have almost never brought close to the limelight, the feeling that precedes a question asked –<i> </i>doubt.</p><p>Before Aristotle discovered that the Earth is round, he questioned the true shape of it. But even before he raised this question, he doubted the existing belief that the Earth is flat.</p><p>Great discoveries are born out of great questions asked. But the need to ask those questions arises out of the doubting the existing scenarios. And although doubt is what sows the seeds of questions and grows into a big tree of answers standing strong in the face of the world, it has never been given the credit it deserves.</p><p>Instead of being seen as the starting point of great discoveries, doubt is rather viewed limited only to what a wife feels when her husband doesn’t return home on time or what your long distance friend feels when you say ‘I miss you’.</p><p><i>‘Will she be on time?’</i></p><p><i>‘I doubt!’</i></p><p>The term doubt is like the Karna of Mahabharata - comes with a good intention, does a lot more than is supposed to, never gets the stardom it deserves.

But this fact needs to be taken as good, contrary to the common feeling attached with ‘doubt’. A population of doubtful people means a population that is raising questions and seeking answers. It means a population that does not blindly accept and a population of many Aristotles and Galileos. A population that is equipped with the ‘Power of Doubt’.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>Illustration credits: Dakshita Joshi</i></p><blockquote><p><i>'Judge a man by his questions, rather than his answers.' -Voltaire</i></p></blockquote><p>Since as far as I can remember, we have kept our ‘questions’ on a very high pedestal. We have applauded our ability to ask intelligent questions. Heck, we have made a profession out of it (read: Journalism). But we have almost never brought close to the limelight, the feeling that precedes a question asked –<i> </i>doubt.</p><p>Before Aristotle discovered that the Earth is round, he questioned the true shape of it. But even before he raised this question, he doubted the existing belief that the Earth is flat.</p><p>Great discoveries are born out of great questions asked. But the need to ask those questions arises out of the doubting the existing scenarios. And although doubt is what sows the seeds of questions and grows into a big tree of answers standing strong in the face of the world, it has never been given the credit it deserves.</p><p>Instead of being seen as the starting point of great discoveries, doubt is rather viewed limited only to what a wife feels when her husband doesn’t return home on time or what your long distance friend feels when you say ‘I miss you’.</p><p><i>‘Will she be on time?’</i></p><p><i>‘I doubt!’</i></p><p>The term doubt is like the Karna of Mahabharata - comes with a good intention, does a lot more than is supposed to, never gets the stardom it deserves. And yet, just like Karna, there is nothing that ceases this word in making its presence felt. Even, in today’s world where people are ready to put a question mark after any accepted belief fed to them.</p><p><i>‘Most Christians have at some point experienced a time of spiritual doubt when they questioned what they believed about their religion or God.’ (CNN, Washington)</i></p><p>We are increasingly becoming a population that is doubtful of a lot of things. But this fact needs to be taken as good, contrary to the common feeling attached with ‘doubt’. A population of doubtful people means a population that is raising questions and seeking answers. It means a population that does not blindly accept and a population of many Aristotles and Galileos. A population that is equipped with the ‘Power of Doubt’.</p>",

You don’t know if it's your mind that’s indecisive or your adrenaline, but at that moment, <i>well</i>, at that exact moment, you&nbsp;<i>just don’t know</i>.</p><p>It would be an understatement to say that it is an out of body experience. While you’re held prisoner outside your flesh and inside your fear, everything feels fast and slow at the same time. People around you fade into the background, your heart reverberates from one edge to another - like a rubber band at its breaking point.</p><p>How many times do you get back in control of everything?</p><p>And how often do you blame yourself for the times that you didn’t?</p><p>Blaming yourself because you could have done more, resisting the temptation to act as if nothing was going on. Thinking in the shower of a thousand things you could’ve said, yet not a word escaped your mouth. Thinking about all the concepts you prepared and studied, yet seemingly vanished into the dark depths of your mind on seeing the questions. Thinking about things you could’ve done and should’ve done. But you didn’t. And that makes all the difference.</p><p>Yet we find solace in the fact that no one else did it either. After all, ignorance&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;bliss, it’s only natural to feel fear. Mankind is built this way, to prioritize their own survival over anything else. Any living creature is. But what separates humans from other sentient life forms is we have the ability to think long term. No longer is our fight-or-flight response, and by extension, our immediate reaction, the most suitable solution for the situation.</p><p>Be it deciding between that lecture or that competition, or the fest or that society meeting - these kinds of decisions pop up everywhere, and it's up to oneself whether to follow their impulses or to collect their thoughts and think. Differentiate between right and wrong and consider all the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Learn to doubt why we doubt. Hesitation is the seed of regret. In the crowd of the frozen, be the one to melt your obstacles away, and stand resolute. A mind of conviction, not one wallowing in self-pity. When you doubt your caliber, remember, it is conviction that composes character during chaos, not conformity.</p><p>At the end, all of life boils down to choice.</p><p>You choose to be who you are. And it is up to you whether you will be a puppet with the strings of life pulling on you. Or whether you will break free, and make your own path. A path not where you questioned yourself, but questioned what lied ahead. A path all your own, filled with potholes and wrong turns, but also one you made with a will of steel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Meeting students from all over the country gave me the sort of exposure that makes a huge difference in itself. This is also the time when one makes long-lasting friends. I still have friends from the 1969 batch and the best part is how we get to learn from each other. People talk about how college is all about learning from books, but what we study will become obsolete in 10 years. What remains is learning how to learn and how to deal with people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did having a technical degree help in what you’ve done after that?</strong></p><p>I did not want to go into Applied Engineering. Hence, right after my graduation, I switched to Industrial Engineering. But, since I have always had a tilt towards the business side of things, that is what I ended up pursuing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the past few years, you’ve invested a lot in education. What motivated you in doing that?</strong></p><p>If you take a look at what we achieve in life, a lot of it has to do with our early education. As an engineer I realized that there was a lack of good business schools and I still feel like that set me back in life a little. I had to learn business the hard way, with hands-on experience. Even today, what we teach in my schools and colleges is the convergence between engineering and business. Secondly, I support only two causes: Education and Health care. If you feed a hungry person once, you’d have to do it every day for it to bear some consequences whereas education is a permanent solution and improves the standard of living for all individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is a sense of ownership that all old alumni feels towards their college. What brings that about?</strong></p><p>There is an old adage that charity begins at home. The feeling of satisfaction that one gets in giving back to a place that gave them so much is very exhilarating. Also, one should always try to leave a place better than how they found it. One wants it to be available for their future generations and influence them in a way better than before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your take on the atmosphere in the USA, especially for students who want to pursue further studies there?</strong></p><p>Politically and socially, the environment is changing very radically. In the US, people used to be very welcoming for anyone wanting to pursue further studies. However, over time, this has transitioned and there are a lot of people coming in that are demolishing the welfare system. However, for a person seeking higher education and adding some value to their country, the gates are always open. The steps they have taken to control their borders come across as shocking probably because this is the first time anything of this sort is happening. But for someone seeking knowledge, they are still very welcoming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How drastic has the change been in DTU till now and what would you like to say to the students that are currently studying here?</strong></p><p>The infrastructure and facilities are excellent. As a leading technical university, our labs should be at par as well. Technology can be put to use to ensure that the students get a more accurate picture of what is going on in the outside world. That being said, if I get to graduate from a college in India today, I would never leave the country. There is enough funding available these days, and all ideas are being appreciated and backed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can the labs here be improved so that positive steps are taken in order to provide a more practical education?</strong></p><p>There needs to be a lot more investment in order to make learning more practical and hands-on. Education is very book-based right now, and it will only be useful if we get to actually apply this learning in our day to day life.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>By Mandeep Singh, COE, 1st Year and Vishesh Kashyap, ME, 3rd Year</strong><br><strong>Illustration by Sourajit Bhattacharjee, ME, 3rd Year</strong></p><p>Throughout history, Punjab has been the hotbed of voices which question tyranny and injustice. When two of her men, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, were unreasonably detained in 1919, the angst and unrest were no different.</p><p>It was the afternoon of 13 April 1919, the traditional and merry festival of Baisakhi. However, little did the crowd of thousands who had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, to protest the arrests of their leaders, know what awaited. An hour into the public meeting, the main entrances of the Bagh was blocked by some ninety-odd men armed with rifles. Leading the charge was a British despot, Colonel Reginald Dyer. Outside the Bagh stood two armoured cars armed with machine guns, unable to enter. Without warning or giving a chance to disperse, the crowd was indiscriminately shot at. The soldiers, belonging to the 2-9th Gurkhas, 54th Sikhs and 59th Sind Rifles, obeyed orders blindly, without any consideration.</p><blockquote><p>''I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made... a fool of myself''</p></blockquote><p>What ensued was the massacre of a thousand civilians. Men, women and children, some as young as weeks old, were slaughtered mercilessly. Dyer ordered his men to fire at the thickest part of the crowd - the exits - until they were out of bullets. 1650 rounds were fired in 10 minutes with over 2000 casualties, including around a thousand deaths. Over a hundred bodies were recovered from the solitary well in the Bagh, which people jumped into to protect themselves from the swarm of bullets. Scores more died or were injured in stampedes. Without any escape routes, or mercy in the heart of the vile colonel, their fate was sealed.</p><p>''I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made... a fool of myself'', said Dyer to the Hunter Commission later that year. Were the entry passage wide enough, “if (machine guns) had been there... I would have opened fire with them.” On helping the wounded, ''Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there'', he said.</p><blockquote><p>Through one barbaric act, the empire the sun never set on forfeited its claim to civility.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It was a sheer cold blooded act of terror, which could never be vindicated. The British establishment happened to be the oldest and most developed in the era, yet, this vicious act was overlooked and dealt as a normal error on Dyer’s part. Even after this unprovoked, abhorrent deed, the administration barely drew any criticism from their overlords in England. Through one barbaric act, the empire the sun never set on forfeited its claim to civility. &nbsp;The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre is an undying blot on the pages of Indo-British relations, written with the blood of a thousand innocent souls. India and its people will never forget this day, and will continue to remember the fallen, in the free atmosphere of this country. Colonel Dyer, will too, continue to be introduced as an unforgivable tyrant in the history books.</p>",

Sahasrabudhe, Chairman, All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), who was the Chief Guest at the 1st International Conference on Signal Processing, VLSI and Communication Engineering (ICSPVCE - 2019) organised at DTU.</i></p><p><strong>How have you seen the technical education field change over the years?</strong></p><p>Technical education started with IIT Roorkee as University of Roorkee and Thomason College in 1847. Now, we have about 160+ years of technical education in this country. In the former years, they were certificate/diploma programmes, and later on, graduated into degree programmes and some colleges became IITs, NITs. Subsequently after Independence, several IITs, NITs came up, while DCE started in 1941. &nbsp;A massive expansion in the technical field took place in the country.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for India's technical education Institutes?</strong></p><p>When this massive expansion took place, we had access and equity; access to anyone who wants Engineering education, and equity in terms of caste, religion, location – rural and urban. Even though access and equity have been matched very well, but when it comes to quality, only 20% of the institutions are of high quality. 30-40% are moderately good and the remaining 30-40% are very poor. Our target is to convert the borderline 30-40% institutions into good institutions. Once we are able to lift all of them, we will be the best technical education provider in the world.</p><p>.<strong>How can the students be motivated to pursue research activities, since only a few voluntarily enter this field?</strong></p><p>I think motivation is sometimes required, but more importantly, when you show the students the possible challenges and plausible solutions, then they will start thinking on their own. That itself is self-motivation. If a student sees a problem, then he can understand the solution and wonder how he can help provide a better solution. In an institution, students can get inspired by looking at their seniors and other professors doing research. Motivation and inspiration come from either a field visit or faculty or any professionals undergoing research.</p><p><strong>What are your views on a huge number of vacant seats in the institutions?</strong></p><p>Vacant seats are remaining because the expansion was sudden and way more than it was necessary. In fact, in some of the states, the number of class 12 (Science) students passing out is way less than the seats available. Hence the expansion was sudden and we have been suffering from consequences of it. Nowadays students join the institutions only if the quality is combined with placement promises. Hence, it should balance out the vacant seats and mass expansion in the next four to five years</p><p><strong>Is the 75% bar really necessary for the students?</strong></p><p>The 75% attendance bar is for students to come forcefully sit in the class. If the teaching-learning process is efficient, they would attend class without any rules. Students will attend the classes if and only if they get new and exciting knowledge. If something is available on a website or on the Internet I wouldn’t bother coming to classes. Students, as I would like to believe, are not at fault, it is the teachers who have to go one step ahead and teach beyond what is available online and discuss challenging problems from those topics. If the student can’t solve the problem, then teachers can devise new ways to pose the problem so that student deeply understands the root of the problem.</p><p><strong>What is your final message for the students?</strong></p><p>I have emphasized that opportunities available to you are plenty and spread in all domains. Every student has opportunities wherever his passion and commitment lie and if he works without expecting anything in the short term and is willing to put in time with all sincerity, success is bound to follow and hence, every student can make the nation proud.</p>",

Trivedi, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, who was the Guest of Honour at the 1st International Conference on Signal Processing, VLSI and Communication Engineering (ICSPVCE - 2019) organised at DTU.</i></p><p><strong>How have you seen the field of Computer Vision and Robotics evolve over the years?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\" One of the most remarkable achievements was the incorporation of Machine Learning.\"</p></blockquote><p>When you’re a part of the journey, you don’t notice much. But the key changes that have taken place are the resources that are required have increased multifold. When I was a graduate student doing object detection, we were looking at wildlife through aerial sensors and it would take us days to get the results. But today when the students perform such analyses, it gives vast results in no time. Prof. Raj Reddy, a pioneer in Robotics and Computer Vision, had a philosophy that the dissertation results weren’t accurate unless they worked on 4 different types of images. That time it was a rigid thing, but today we perform experiments on large datasets of images. One of the most remarkable achievements was the incorporation of Machine Learning. Earlier, we used predefined features, which needed specific knowledge of the data. Today we have data for every feature available for learning.</p><p><strong>Collaboration between academia and industry is very important. In San Diego, as shown in your lecture, you’ve collaborated with industry giants. But in India, we seldom find such collaborations and the existing ones are too limited. What are your views on this?</strong></p><p>I think everybody realises that we have the same objectives at a higher level. But we have different expertise and infrastructure. Unless we really put it all together, we cannot solve the problem and nobody wins. So once people have developed some trustworthy relationships, good things will start happening. The industry also is hiring students from universities, so they have a very good idea of happenings inside the universities. The task is the same but the difference in an industry is that there it is commercial and profit-making. The freedom to think freely might not be available in the industry. But if you know people with similar ideas and thinking, you’ll feel comfortable being and working with them.</p><p><strong>It is often said that students need to be motivated to pursue research? Do you really think a motivating factor is needed, or this should come from within?</strong></p><p>Most successful students I’ve seen have a high amount of self-motivation. Whenever I need to bring in new students, I tell them to interact with other students in the group because peer-to-peer interaction is very important. It might not be necessary for some theorist like Ramanujan, with high thinking skills, but this isn’t the case with us. We certainly want to emphasise that people are respectful of others ideas and help out each other. People understand that I might be helping you today, and you might help me tomorrow. People then enjoy working and collaborating.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest challenge that the Robotics industry still faces even today?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"... works in real-life with continuous interaction, without humans feeling threatened\"</p></blockquote><p>Safety, Robustness, Generalisation and Human Centeredness. I believe that making one-of-a-kind is no big deal, but making it robust and able to work in a variety of situations as well as interact with humans is very important, and hasn’t been yet achieved. There are a lot of open issues left unresolved. A robot that works in an artificial environment is not needed; what’s required is one which works in real-life with continuous interaction, without humans feeling threatened or stressed.</p><p><strong>What final message would you like to give to the students?</strong></p><p>I am very impressed and glad to visit DTU. I really wish a large number of students from here contribute to the community of Robotics and Intelligent Systems. I’m sure you’ll be successful. I want to re-emphasise that particularly in this field you might end up building something life-saving. I wish you all the best!</p>",

Dutta Roy, former Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, who was the Guest of Honour at the 1st International Conference on Signal Processing, VLSI and Communication Engineering (ICSPVCE - 2019) organised at DTU.</i></p><p><strong>Your lectures on Circuit Theory are considered one of the best starting points in the course. Almost every student has watched them before attending the classes. What according to you is the best way of learning, a teacher teaching physically, a lecture series or reading about it from a book?</strong></p><p>You must combine all of these. But the most important thing is not to accept any notes from anyone, be it your father, peers or your teachers. Many ask me the reason for this tip. Unless you are satisfied, don’t give up! If a teacher says something which is not appealing to you then ask why. If the teacher is clueless then don't stop, instead go on asking again and again until the teacher is forced to explain. The same is the case with your parents or for that matter anyone else. Unless you are satisfied, never stop trying. Always listen and go by your conscience. Your conscience can never be wrong!</p><p>The main motto behind learning is to never give up or stop trying and go on asking why until you find an answer. There is no shortcut of learning, i.e., the path of learning always requires hard work.</p><p><strong>How do you think that the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering has changed over the years?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"There is no field in the industry which hasn’t been enriched due to the development of the electronics sector.\"</p></blockquote><p>Well, firstly it was a composite branch. All the branches grew larger in size and bifurcated into parts such as Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Engineering. But Electronics and Communication Engineering is still a composite discipline. It has its wings in all fields such as mechatronics, power electronics etc. The branch has diversified by giving rise to many souvenir disciplines.</p><p>Communication has gone through such a revolutionary change that even Communication Engineering is a discipline on its own. It has progressed much beyond our imagination. Speech-to-text conversion, Facial Recognition, Interpretations of mood of a person, Biometric Identification, even Classical music has also undergone various changes with the advent of electronics in its field. There is no field in the industry which hasn’t been enriched due to the development of the electronics sector.</p><p><strong>It was rightly pointed out that the field of Signal Processing has seen a valley. What are your comments on this?</strong></p><p>Most of the research that has been done carefully avoids the current problem. They are wandering on the periphery and the applications. I’ll be talking more about this during my lecture.</p><p><strong>Institutions are giving autonomy so that they can perform better. But there are various unnecessary rules and regulations that govern research at these institutes. What are your views on this?</strong></p><p>Any level of freedom must be coupled with self-imposed discipline. And therefore autonomy doesn’t mean that you can do anything. You must on what the autonomy is given to you for. Similarly, in life, you are a free person but you must be bound by some self-imposed rules and regulations either by your parents, your friends or your service. Try to be original rather than copying from someone.</p><p><strong>Do you believe that the 75% attendance bar is necessary for students?</strong></p><p>I have worked in institutions where there was no such rule for attendance. If the teacher is good, then attendance doesn’t become a problem. So personally I am not in favour of such attendance rules. But I also realised after teaching in IITs for quite a long time, that the students who come from school find a lot of freedom in college and they tend to go wild. So at least for the first two semesters, I feel that the attendance rule must be upheld and they must not be allowed to go away from the purpose for which they came there.</p><blockquote><p>\"I saw, in those eyes, the problem right away.\"</p></blockquote><p>Let me give you an example. There was a boy whose AIR was 4 or 5. I found out that he had &nbsp;somehow managed to just pass his semester exams. I decided to approach him, and so I went to his room. Unfortunately he wasn’t there and on being asked, his roomate revealed that he is in the library. I found him out there and I told him to look at my eyes. He wouldn’t. I said again “Look at my eyes”. When he finally looked, I saw, in those eyes, the problem right away. He was lost. He was caught in a bad company in the hostels.</p><p>His parents came the next day to my home. His mother’s eyes were filled with tears. &nbsp;There was only one solution. I told him to come to every class from now on. He would come and sit on the last bench. I would call him to sit in the front and ask him what we had covered in the last class. I would call him to solve problems on the board. It was really surprising to see a student of such great calibre not being able to solve the problem on the board. As time passed, his condition improved. He passed his B.Tech with 9+ GPA and got admittedly immediately to Belgian University. Before going, he seeked me for my blessings. But we lost contact.</p><p>4 years later, I received a package from him. It had a note which said, “I was able to do this, all because of just one man. You!” I got very emotional about it. After that we met quite a few times and I am happy that he is doing really well.</p>",

Although, its not only about going abroad but also much you go within. It is necessary for a person to dig in deeper into one’s own thought process to simplify his or her own thoughts.

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Professor Lauro Emilio Gonzalez Farias is a part of the Department of Finance at School of Business Administration of São Paulo, Brazil, where he also coordinates of the Center for Studies in Microfinance and Financial Inclusion.&nbsp;</strong></i><br><i><strong>He was a visiting professor at Université Paris-Dauphine, France, between 2013 and 2017, a visiting researcher at Columbia University, United States, from 2014 to 2015, and a fellow of the Microfinance Management Institute in 2005.&nbsp;</strong></i><br><i><strong>He was at Delhi Technological University for International Conference on Business and Management, organised by Delhi School of Management from 29-30 March 2019.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the span of almost two decades, you have worked your way through a bachelor’s degree in business administration, a master's and a subsequent Ph.D. in business economics, followed by a postdoctoral. What drove you to study the field with such depth?</strong></p><p>When I was at my business undergraduate school, I liked economics. I wanted to get deeper into the subject. I was curious and wanted to study more about it.<br>In the beginning, I combined consulting and research. But as time went on, I saw myself doing more research than consulting. It was then that I realized that I was happy in the field of academia.<br>It’s a good thing that at School of Business Administration of São Paulo, there’s a connection to the market. This makes it easy to conduct research. At the same time, I direct the Centre for Microfinance and Financial Inclusion Studies where we do applied research and address issues related to real-life situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What were your observations during your stay in Brazil, France, and the US?</strong></p><p>It was very exciting to have a teaching opportunity in France subsequently followed by one in the US. I wasn’t expecting such an opportunity to come up in France. However, once I got it, I eventually ended up going there seven times in a row.<br>I had done a part of my Ph.D. in Columbia. Going back to the United States helped me reconnect.<br>In both cases, I taught the subject of financial inclusion. It also happens to be the subject of the Centre for Microfinance and Financial Inclusion Studies at the School of Business Administration of São Paulo.<br>In France, the students are more formal and you have to provoke them to engage. In the US, they are less formal and more engaging from the very start. Also, students in the US were from all over the world and that was an enriching experience. Overall, the level of debates and discussions was good and they were interesting. Even more so, because I was able to compare their thought process with that of the students I have in Brazil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What can you say about the effect of poor financial literacy in developing countries?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"...people are not buying what they want, but what their financial institutions want to sell\"</p></blockquote><p>People have to be better educated to be well-prepared for consumption of financial services.<br>However, when people use financial products they are being influenced and provoked by the institutions. The people are not buying what they want, but what their financial institutions want to sell. There is a lot of manipulation in the market. There’s a very interesting book titled ‘Phishing for Phools’ which analyses multiple such cases.<br>The bottom line is that good financial education should be provided to both: the borrowers as well as the banks &amp; institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What conclusions have you drawn from your research on segmentation in financial services in Brazil?</strong></p><p>The main takeaway from the research is that there are various profiles when it comes to different financial services. The poor are many-a-times classified in just one single category, however there are many different types of ‘poor’. The base of the pyramid is very heterogeneous.<br>For example, some people consume a lot of credit and get indebted, and some people don’t like using credit and are very much in control of their expenditures. Financial services and products have to be made to cater to wider needs of the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Students are often confused about what they want to do with their future. What would you suggest for them?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"If you have a lot of certainty at an early age you’re doing something wrong\"</p></blockquote><p>First of all, I would like to say that confusion is a part of life. If you have a lot of certainty at an early age you’re doing something wrong. It is good to have doubts. As someone who has researched the bottom of the social pyramid, I’d say that this is an appropriate doubt to have. We come from developing countries and it is possible that we could be in a much worse situation.<br>My advice would be to enjoy this period of your life and get as much as you can from the environment, the academia, and the university. Some of you, like me, will eventually return to the academia and give back.</p>",

I realised that people often face a traumatic situation where it is difficult to cope up with the fact that their loved one will not be with them after a few months. It is difficult to overcome this emotional ordeal. On observing these incidents, I realised that the human mind is extremely brave. It is possible to extend your years if you have determination and that is why I got into this field to make people aware that cancer can be triumphed over. I also studied Microbiology to better understand the disease and help the suffering people through my NGO.</p><p><strong>How has being a Miss India finalist, a motivational speaker, a women's rights activist and a social entrepreneur shape your personality?</strong></p><p>I had lost a lot of weight and gotten into modelling. My friends suggested that participating in the Miss India pageant was the next logical step. According to me, the human mind is often underestimated. We should challenge it every day to test our own capabilities. I like to try different things in life and often challenge myself with unique ventures to get better.</p><p><strong>You are active on both online and offline platforms speaking for women's rights and the stigma surrounding a women’s body. What do you think about the present state of our country on the same issues?</strong></p><p>I think that the situation in the metropolitan cities is getting better. Women are becoming aware of their rights and speaking up for themselves. I am also against certain reservations given on the basis of gender to women. I believe there should be equal opportunities for people from both the genders.</p><p><strong>What message would you like to give to the students of this college?</strong></p><p>I would like to tell them not to be hesitant from pursuing any other career other than engineering. Often students are forced into engineering and they should make their decisions on their own about the life they wish to lead. I strongly believe that if you are not happy with your own choices in life, you would be unable to provide happiness to anyone around you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Did passion towards your field play a role?</strong></p><p>The reason for choosing GATE, since the start, was to be eligible for public sector jobs.</p><p>I strongly believe that passion towards your branch is the most critical requirement for this journey, since during this large span of preparation, you have to remain motivated. Some candidates start their preparation only to find out later that they no longer want to continue.</p><p><strong>What is the ideal preparation strategy for GATE? Is classroom knowledge enough? How would you compare self study to coaching?</strong></p><p>I believe that the ideal preparation strategy lies in practice. I advise every candidate to practice as much as they can. Speaking about my branch, i.e., Computer Science &amp; I.T., we have around 9-10 major subjects, so a candidate cannot leave a single subject assuming it to be of less importance. Every subject has equal weightage in the exam and thus, all are equally important.</p><p>Self study is important but I think that it is a blend of coaching and self study which gives the best results. Coaching is important because it provides you with a framework.</p><p><strong>How did you balance between preparing for semester exams and preparing for GATE?</strong></p><p>Finding a balance between the end semester exams and GATE preparation was, in fact, the real challenge. In this regard, I would like to thank my mentor, Mr. Sanjay Kumar, Department of Computer Science and Engineering for his invaluable contribution during the important stages of preparation. He was a constant support and guided me during the time when most of the candidates either drop out or get overly demotivated. Due to his assistance, I focused on revising the GATE syllabus even during the end semester exams, though it &nbsp;affected my CGPA.</p><p><strong>Since you are a top scorer, many options will be open for you. Which one would you choose, Masters or PSU?</strong><br><br>I will go for some Public Sector Undertaking (PSU). It was my aim from the very beginning to work in the public sector domain, and this would be the perfect opportunity for me.</p><p><strong>Was GATE your only plan? Did you have backup plans as well?</strong></p><p>I got a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) from a very reputed company after my internship, so that was always my backup. A good plan-B always helps you to cope with stress, and enter new areas.</p><p><strong>What difference do you feel exists between JEE and GATE, in terms of both, preparation and competition?</strong></p><p>JEE and GATE are very different exams. JEE has more number of students and is more competitive than GATE. A student appears in JEE right after school, while GATE aspirants are either straight out of college or have a few years of experience. The pressure and stress levels associated with both the competitive exams are very different.</p>",

Did passion for your field play a role?</strong></p><p>Passion in one’s field does play a very important role. I began by searching up various research possibilities in the Computer Science field and hence, decided that I want to study further and develop my knowledge in other specific areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Thus, I decided that I want to proceed by taking the GATE.</p><p><strong>2. What is the ideal preparation strategy for GATE? Is classroom knowledge enough? How would you compare self-study to coaching?</strong></p><p>GATE focuses a lot on the fundamentals, hence you must have a very clear idea about them since the beginning. One should prepare a subject thoroughly and then practise according to the previous year questions. Since the syllabus for the GATE just mentions <i>topic’s name</i> and does not specifically tell the specific areas that one needs to cover in it, so if you try to cover everything contained in a topic, the syllabus will look vast and difficult.</p><p>Self-study, according to me, is very important. Practising more and more questions is the key to success in the GATE. &nbsp;If even you study a topic thoroughly and the question can trick your brain. It is thus important to take as many mock tests as possible and solve maximum questions.</p><p><strong>How did you balance between preparing for semester exams and preparing for GATE?</strong></p><p>You just have to be regular in classes for acing the semester exams and ideally, you can start preparing about five to six days before the exams commence. The GATE requires regular and extensive study hours and luckily you score enough time for it too in the seventh semester.</p><p><strong>Since you are a top scorer, many options would be open for you. Which one would you choose, Masters or PSU?</strong></p><p>I wish to go for higher studies. I wouldn’t have chosen PSU, because if my motive was to settle on a job, I wouldn’t have written the GATE and would have chosen other private companies with better opportunities.</p><p><strong>Was GATE your only plan? Did you have backup plans as well?</strong></p><p>If I had decided to not take the GATE then I would have applied for jobs in private companies and would have considered MS or MBA after one or two years.</p><p><strong>What difference do you feel exists between JEE and GATE, in terms of both, preparation and competition?</strong></p><p>In the JEE, about 10 lakh candidates take the exam whereas, in the GATE, about one to two lakh candidates write the exam, per branch,and thus students compete branch-wise as compared to all engineering aspirants in the JEE.&nbsp;</p><p>GATE syllabus is vaster; about 10-15 % questions are new or tricky and hence you need good time management skills, whereas in the JEE (Advanced) you can expect 50-60% new and tricky questions and one gets enough time for problems.</p>",

Perhaps even replacing the national currency. Why do you think so?</strong></p><p>When the Wright brothers invented the flying machine, do you think anyone volunteered to go flying on it? When a new technology that is potentially revolutionary comes along, people are usually hesitant to going along with it. Blockchain isn’t necessarily a replacement, its meant for ease of access alongside security.</p><p>We can actually build small communities and give power to the individuals to exchange within themselves. I didn't talk about national currencies because they are issued by the sovereign and we have to have a democracy introduce it.</p><p>Basically it can curb inflation. Digital assets don't have a printing press, for cryptocurrencies. Decentralization reduces administrative costs and allows for an easy storing and investing mechanism.</p><p><strong>Recently decentralized cryptocurrencies have become a big question mark, and many countries have in fact banned Bitcoin etc. How can we increase the peoples trust in the cryptocurrency market?</strong></p><p>When you talk about trust, what has happened in Nirav Modi’s case? He took a lot of money, your hard earned money and ran away. How many of the families got affected by the demonetization movement? Do you trust your identity? Aadhar has become necessary to link to PayTM. What if you wake up tomorrow and your bank credentials are compromised? We have seen it in the case of Mariott, 1.6 billion identities got compromised. 50 million accounts on Facebook. iCloud, close to 10 million+ nude photos out on the internet.</p><p>We are again getting stuck in a vicious cycle of trusting the centralized systems. Digital assets you don't have to link it from a perspective that it can replace the currencies. No, it has to exist hand in hand. Now the big question is can bitcoin act as a payment mechanism? It can act as a store of value? Probably yes. I haven’t been to a bank account in the past one year. My dad used to take a day off to go to the bank. Things are becoming digitized, but when things are becoming digitized, there's an underlying question which is coming up. The question of trust. You trust someone who is reliable and do not play with the kind of services you have asked for. So can digital assets actually bring about prosperity or an evolution in the economy? Against it has to be a holy trinity, which I will talk about. The existence of even at the atomic level, electrons exist with protons and neutrons. So I see that a combination of Blockchain with IoT and AI will play a crucial role in the economy. If I throw more light on it, say remittance. 10 years back my uncle used to transfer money from the India to the US. There was a huge cost to it, nowadays cryptocurrencies can solve that problem. You can’t remit money on Sunday mornings.</p><p>So it can't overshadow the national currency, it has to go hand in hand.</p><p><strong>What would your message be to fellow engineers?</strong></p><p>If you do not make machines more intelligent, machines will make you slaves. Do not fear that machines will replace you, there will be different opportunities which machines can’t do. Machines don't have emotions machines cant think. Of course they are more efficient since they can work around the clock. Message for all the fellow engineers, do not get stuck in a brick and mortar routine. Do not believe that getting a job is the only aim in life. Explore emerging technologies like Blockchain, AI, IoT. And the best way to explore is to educate from the fundamentals. Have the power of unlearning, the moment you start unlearning the learning starts becoming more enjoyable. Age doesn't matter, the new generation definitely has the potential to leave behind the old technology’s trajectory and re impact and the Indian economy.</p><p>So the message revolves around do not settle, keep on unlearning and learning.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Vicky Roy, street photographer featured in Forbes Asia's 30 under 30, who was invited as a speaker at TEDxDTU'19.</i></p><p><strong>Your early has been quite eventful, you came here from Puruliya, how has that affected your photography?</strong></p><p>Actually when I came here I didn't know I’d become a photographer. In fact, I did not know till 2007. After my class 10th, I started photography. It was based in my mind that for professional photography you had to know English, but I studied in a Hindi medium school. Hence I thought the furthest I could go was as an Assistant. Luckily, I found a strong mentor who guided me to become a professional photographer.</p><p><strong>How did you get to know about your passion for photography?</strong></p><p>In 2004 there was a workshop on photography in my NGO, Salaam Balak. The person had come from Indonesia to do it. So in 10th when my NGO teacher asked me what I wanted to do, it clicked in my head that if I do photography, I would get to visit the world.</p><p><strong>You got a contract from Maybach Foundation to cover the reconstruction of the World Trade Center. How was that experience?</strong></p><p>First they had conducted a competition worldwide in which Ram Chandra Nath Foundation had nominated me. Then they had asked for pictures of construction sites. I had shot pictures of Delhi Metro and its construction but my mentor said there are bigger trains out there and this doesn’t cover the essence of India. Show them the Indian perspective. So I went to Rajasthan and clicked the Indian workers who worked wearing colourful photos, with the women having pots on their heads.</p><p>After that, I made it to the top 10 and by an interview process I was chosen to cover the reconstruction.</p><p><strong>What message would you have for the budding photographers of today?</strong></p><p>I notice whenever anyone starts photography, they expect everything will happen in 6 months, but its a simple logic that you have to spend a good amount of time to become a successful photographer, like any other profession.</p><p><strong>Why should events like TEDx be organized?</strong></p><p>There's a saying that if you have knowledge you should share it, that’s why events like TEDx should be organized.</p>",

I realised that people often face a traumatic situation where it is difficult to cope with the fact that their loved one may not be with them after a few months. It is difficult to overcome this emotional ordeal. After observing such incidents, I realised that the human mind is extremely brave.

How would you say all this shaped your personality or character?</strong></p><p>I had lost a lot of weight and gotten into modelling. My friends suggested that participating in the Miss India pageant would be the next logical step.&nbsp;<br>According to me, the human mind is often underestimated.

Women are becoming aware of their rights and speaking up for themselves. Delhi however, remains an exception, as the situation here is deteriorating day by day.&nbsp;<br>I am also against certain reservations given on the basis of gender to women. I believe there should be equal opportunities for people from both the genders.</p><p><strong>What message would you like to give to the students of Delhi Technological University?</strong></p><p>I would like to tell them not to be hesitant about pursuing any career other than in the field of engineering. Often students are forced into engineering. They should be making their own decisions about the life they wish to lead down the road. I strongly believe that if you are not happy with your own choices in life, you will be unable to provide happiness to anyone around you.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Umang Dokania, 4th Year, COE who achieved an All India Rank of 5 in the Computer Science paper of the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) 2019.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What has been your inspiration behind choosing GATE specifically, amongst the other options? Did passion for your field play a role?</strong></p><p>Passion in one’s field does play a very important role. I began by searching up various research possibilities in the Computer Science field and hence, decided that I want to study further and develop my knowledge in other specific areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Thus, I decided that I want to proceed by taking the GATE.</p><p><strong>What is the ideal preparation strategy for GATE? Is classroom knowledge enough? How would you compare self-study to coaching?</strong></p><p>GATE focuses a lot on the fundamentals, hence you must have a very clear idea about them since the beginning. One should prepare a subject thoroughly and then practise according to the previous year questions. Since the syllabus for the GATE just mentions <i>topic’s name</i> and does not specifically tell the specific areas that one needs to cover in it, so if you try to cover everything contained in a topic, the syllabus will look vast and difficult.</p><p>Self-study, according to me, is very important. Practising more and more questions is the key to success in the GATE. &nbsp;If even you study a topic thoroughly and the question can trick your brain. It is thus important to take as many mock tests as possible and solve maximum questions.</p><p><strong>How did you balance between preparing for semester exams and preparing for GATE?</strong></p><p>You just have to be regular in classes for acing the semester exams and ideally, you can start preparing about five to six days before the exams commence. The GATE requires regular and extensive study hours and luckily you score enough time for it too in the seventh semester.</p><p><strong>Since you are a top scorer, many options would be open for you. Which one would you choose, Masters or PSU?</strong></p><p>I wish to go for higher studies. I wouldn’t have chosen PSU, because if my motive was to settle on a job, I wouldn’t have written the GATE and would have chosen other private companies with better opportunities.</p><p><strong>Was GATE your only plan? Did you have backup plans as well?</strong></p><p>If I had decided to not take the GATE then I would have applied for jobs in private companies and would have considered MS or MBA after one or two years.</p><p><strong>What difference do you feel exists between JEE and GATE, in terms of both, preparation and competition?</strong></p><p>In the JEE, about 10 lakh candidates take the exam whereas, in the GATE, about one to two lakh candidates write the exam, per branch,and thus students compete branch-wise as compared to all engineering aspirants in the JEE.&nbsp;</p><p>GATE syllabus is vaster; about 10-15 % questions are new or tricky and hence you need good time management skills, whereas in the JEE (Advanced) you can expect 50-60% new and tricky questions and one gets enough time for problems.</p>",

We have seen it in many cases like that of Mariott and Facebook, to name a few. Trust among the people is slowly built, there is no shortcut in this aspect, and there should not be any as well. When the Wright brothers invented the flying machine, do you think anyone volunteered to go flying on it? Certainly not. When a new technology, that is potentially revolutionary, comes along people are usually hesitant to go along with it.</p><p><strong>What would your message be to fellow engineers?</strong></p><p>If you do not make machines more intelligent, machines will make you slaves. Do not fear that machines will replace you, there always will be different opportunities that machines are unable to perform. Machines don't have emotions, and they can’t think. Of course, they are more efficient since they have the ability to work all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Message for all the fellow engineers, do not get stuck in a brick and mortar routine. Do not believe that getting a job is the only aim in life. Explore emerging technologies like blockchain, AI and IoT. The best way to explore is to educate yourself with the fundamentals. Have the power of unlearning, because the moment you start unlearning, the real learning begins and becomes more enjoyable. Age doesn't matter, the new generation definitely has the potential to leave behind the old technology’s trajectory and have a major impact on the Indian economy. Do not settle, keep on unlearning and learning.</p>",

What role does DTU have to play in your success?</strong></p><p>I decided to pursue Management after I had the opportunity to work on a research project in IIM Ahmedabad. I realised that doing an MBA from a premier institute will not only enrich you in knowledge from the professors, but also from your peers and make you industry-ready.</p><p>DTU has some of the finest brains in the country. Hence, I had the opportunity to prepare for entrance exams with them which helped me in the long run.</p><p><strong>How does having a technical degree help someone who wants to foray into management?</strong></p><p>A technical degree is very helpful for honing your analytical skills. Any organization runs on three basic things: Man, Machine and Capital. A technical degree gives you the knowledge of a Machine and a Business administration degree compliments it with the knowledge of handling manpower and capital. Basically, if you have a technical degree along with qualification in Business Administration, you have a holistic view of how business organizations are run and how can they be improved.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to prepare for such management entrances? How did you prepare and balance college work with the entrances?</strong></p><p>Most of the management entrance exams are aptitude-based exams covering topics like Verbal Ability, Data Interpretation, Logical Reasoning and Basic Quantitative Ability. One does not need outright help for them. However, I suggest that aspirants can take up online or offline coaching from any reliable institute as they have a lot of experience that helps you to tackle exams better, identify weak areas and most importantly provide a mock exam series that goes a long way in making you exam ready.</p><p>I took offline coaching and regularly gave Mocks to improve. Graduation marks are very important criteria in most of the B-school selection process, I made sure that during my mid-semester and end-semester examinations, I completely focus on college and rest of the time I prepared for entrance exams.</p><p><strong>What is the relative importance of academics and extracurricular activities for getting into a good management institute?</strong></p><p>Academics are really important for getting into a good B-school. Most of the top B-schools give weightage of 10-30% to academics in the final selection process, which includes class 10th,12th and graduation marks. Also, a good academic record is a validation of your sincerity towards academics and every B-school looks for that. Extracurricular activities do not play a role in your selection procedure; however, extraordinary extracurricular achievements can help you create a good impression in your personal interview.</p><p><strong>How are the Group Discussion and Personal Interview rounds conducted and how does one prepare for them? What are some of the most interesting questions that you were asked during the interviews?</strong></p><p>GD and PI rounds are conducted a couple of months after CAT post the release of shortlists by various colleges. The best way to prepare for interviews is to look for interview experiences of that particular B-school, and work on things that are specifically required by that B-school. General questions are on why M.B.A., General knowledge, Maths and your graduation subjects.</p><p>Questions in my interviews were pretty general. But in my introduction, I had mentioned that I am a stand-up comedian, hence, in my IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Calcutta interviews I was asked to perform stand-up comedy during the interview.</p><p><strong>What advice would you like to give to all students aiming at getting into IIMs and other prolific management institutes?’</strong></p><p>My advice to all the aspirants would be that they should make a balance between graduation exams and MBA exam preparations as graduation marks are really important.

Did passion for your field play a role?</strong></p><p>A good job in a top PSU has always been my dream, given that it provides job security accompanied by an attractive package. Even though it wasn't my passion but as I wanted to stay in touch with my field as well, I would choose PSUs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the ideal preparation strategy for GATE? Is classroom knowledge enough? How would you compare self-study to coaching?</strong></p><p>Even though there is no ideal strategy, it is all about staying focussed, analysing your strengths and weaknesses and being loyal to the preparation. Even though a good rank isn't in our hands, the preparation for it is, and it is onto us to our best shot.<br>Classroom coaching is theoretical, while the GATE tests a person's problem solving skills within limited time and under pressure.<br>Self-study is good for those who have a decent grasp over the concepts since the beginning and it requires one to be disciplined and dedicated as well. I was an average student during my college days and almost started from ground zero when I started preparing. I decided to join a coaching because I started preparing from the ground zero and I felt it keeps you motivated towards your goal while providing a competitive environment for timely evaluation of you.</p><p><strong>How did you balance between preparing for semester exams and preparing for GATE?</strong></p><p>Since my main aim was GATE and I had a decent percentage (70+), I invested my time mainly in preparing for the GATE.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Since you are a top scorer, many options would be open for you. Which one would you choose, Masters or PSU?</strong></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I am aiming for a good PSU and hence haven't applied for M.tech this time because I don't want to hog any IIT seat.</p><p><strong>Was GATE your only plan? Did you have backup plans as well?</strong></p><p>Yes, it was mainly GATE 2019 while I also prepared for DMRC and ISRO. In the beginning, I had started preparing for GATE+ESE, but with time I realised that I had to focus on one thing at a time. Hence, I prepared for GATE 2019 with utmost dedication and planned to prepare for ESE 2020 later.</p><p><strong>What difference do you feel exists between JEE and GATE, in terms of both, preparation and competition?</strong></p><p>During JEE, our brains are still in the developing phase and the aspirants are mainly the students of Class 12th.<br>But in the GATE, we have a wide range of people appearing, varying from ages 22 to 30 (or even more), or students finishing B.Tech. Moreover, it is difficult to manage a bunch of subjects at once.<br>Both of these exams are incomaprable and have their own pros and cons.</p><p>My only advice to the aspirants is that they should stay focussed and never give up after getting bad results in the tests and keep oneself unaffected from distractions.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Ram Sampath, music composer and producer, who was invited as a speaker at TEDxDTU'19.</i></p><p><strong>You started out in the advertisement industry and worked your way through Bollywood to become an established music composer. How would you describe your journey?</strong></p><p>I believe that my journey has been varied. I started composing at the age of 16 and tried out a variety of things. I always wanted to create an independent scene in India which was not based on English music. My first interest was non-film work and I did some independent albums. Advertisement used to pay my bills and I would pursue my interest by composing music for albums. Advertisement is a great training ground as you are paid to learn different genres. I am always thankful for that and it has been rewarding for me to work in that industry. In India, films and Bollywood is the next logical step and what is important is that you also need to meet the right people and start with the right project to work on. I find the technique and technology in music to be fascinating. I am not just interested in doing the songs for the film but also the background and music score. I am also excited to see the increase in importance given to the background score of a movie in Bollywood recently.</p><p><strong>You have worked with many eminent and well-known personalities in Bollywood. Who was the most fun to work with and in what way?</strong></p><p>I have worked with both Amir and Shah Rukh as producers on different projects and have enjoyed their company. My relationship with Amir is pretty tight and we have a personal relationship. His primary drive is to always enhance the story telling experience. Over the years, I have learned quite a few things from him. He always tells that the best idea in the room always wins whoever the source maybe. This is a very important lesson as it leads to everybody collaborating and brainstorming together; hierarchies are also minimized.</p><p><strong>You followed your passion in life and chose music as a career. How often would you recommend choosing an unconventional path as one’s profession?</strong></p><p>I would recommend it to every human being to always follow their passion because the only safe path in life is the risky one. If you are not happy, no amount of money can compensate for that fact. I believe the new generation should understand that a person can have multiple careers in a lifetime. If you’re 30 and you decide to follow a new career path then that is okay too as long as you are not frivolous.</p><p><strong>Who would you say are your idols in the industry and how did you decide to follow your passion for music?</strong></p><p>Well, if I start listing my heroes it would go on and on. But I can definitely say that the most exciting thing for me was the integration of technology into music. It got me thinking about taking music as a career. The first question that parents ask is if you can make a living out of it. Technology helped me answer that question. I believe that I am still one of the few musicians who is adept in both the creative as well as the technical aspects of music. I not only compose but also mix and master my own songs. I am also one of the few people outside America who works with Apple on their music software and product development. I feel great pride in being connected to music in the technological sense as well. Most of the youth nowadays are technically well versed with music and one of the odd things that is happening right now is that composing may be suffering but the music production is surely on the rise.</p><p><strong>What message would you like to give to the college students?</strong></p><p>You have to be brave in life and try to trust your own intuitions. You may feel that you are swimming against the tide but you might be the only one swimming towards safety. You never know how things are going to work out in life and the important thing in life is to always enjoy. I would also advice the youth to try and see things through. One of the big problems in India is that we are not closers. Be a closer. It is important to be committed in life towards your goal.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Ashish Joshi, CEO of Classic Legends Pvt. Ltd., who was invited as a speaker at TEDxDTU'19.</i></p><p><strong>You were a part of the IEEE during your engineering and also a member of the Business Forum during your post-graduation days in London. How important a role do you think such societies play in the college days?</strong></p><p>These are a very important part of one’s college life. You gain leadership qualities from roles such as these. During my engineering, we used to organise an event of the electrical department called ‘Expressions’. One year we decided not to reach out to sponsors for monetary support but to sell out stall space for computer parts’ manufacturers as computer tech was the hot topic at that time. We thought differently and succeeded in organizing an event for the department. Incidents like these teach you leadership at a young age, so being part of these events is very important in terms of how it shapes your character going forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you discover your passion for motorcycles and got interested in the automotive industry?</strong></p><p>As a young kid being surrounded by all sorts of army vehicles piqued my interest in the field of motorcycles. I was taught how to ride a motorcycle when I was 13 got into trouble at home for it. I have always felt a connection with the roads when I am on a motorcycle. The wind behind your ears and sweeping over your face as you go on a ride is one of the best feelings you can have. I still just get on a bike and go for a 20-30 km ride to take a break and relax on the road. Motorcycles are a great means for destressing for me and are very close to my heart. It is not about riding fast but about what you feel at that point of time and the moods you go through. It is about letting go. I always come back clear headed after a ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you plan to compete with the major players such as Royal Enfield that are already established in India? How do Jawa motorcycles stand out?</strong></p><p>Jawa Motorcycles is a design-based brand. Our product speaks for us. As far as competing with another brand goes, I am not sure we would be competing with them. Jawa is a brand in itself and it is more than about motorcycles. It connects to that nostalgia and emotional part from your past or that story that is told to you by your grandfather and you want to experience it yourself. It is relevant for millennials as for them authencity and form are big factors. If it looks good with an authentic story then you can connect to it at a nostalgic level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What other skills do you think are necessary for an engineer in life apart from technical knowledge?</strong></p><p>Attitude is key. Attitude is not only how you communicate with others but qualities such as bravery and fearlessness towards challenges. When you stop taking no for an answer, that is the right attitude needed in life. You should be able to handle the criticism and be fearless if you want to work with any good corporation. I usually make my new recruits go through all sorts of challenges to make them fearless and test them. You should have technical skills but you can always study about a subject nowadays. Everybody did not have access to the same knowledge some years back but today the scene is quite different. What you do with the knowledge you have is what is most important. Most people today want the easy way out with lesser hours and good pay in IT jobs. But a decade down the line all your sharpness is dulled and dimmed and you don’t know much about how an industry works out side of your monitor. We need our engineering graduates to bring about a culture of manufacturing products. We should not just end up being the backyard boys for the western countries who use us as the service providers for the rest of the world or working in call centres for foreign companies.</p><p>I also advise you to have an audacious goal in life. Unless you can see a vision for yourself, you will not be able to plan a path for yourself. Don’t get bogged down with the nitty-gritties of life. People may doubt you, but that needs to be your fuel. It might not be easy but remember that if it were, everybody would be doing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engineering graduates nowadays are more interested in innovating things and the field of entrepreneurship. But are often led down by the lack of management skills. How do you think an engineer should acquire the required business skills for a startup?</strong></p><p>Every company is different and requires different skills, but what is necessary for a start up is a good dose of realism. An entrepreneur should be willing to put everything on the line. If you can’t put in the effort and lead by example people will not follow you. Every start up might have a brilliant idea but one also needs to focus on the execution. What happens when the seed money behind the idea runs out? If you do not plan out the best possible execution of the idea then it proves fatal for the company. This is the differentiating factor for start-ups. The message for engineers is that just don’t go with the idea but also plan out the execution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Her bright crimson armour reflected light in all directions, as it shined in an illusion. Her slick black hair was tightly tied up in a high ponytail as she stood at the centre of the arena, slowly ungriping her weapons as she bent down with a hunch and let them on the ground. She sat cross-legged comfortably on the ground, closed her eyes as she tried to contain the rising tension of the room. She felt the heat in the air on her pale face as she began to sweat. She was early.</p><p>As time stopped, The Superior One entered with a look of concern on his face and an envelope, out of which thick papers stuck out, almost falling on the ground, as the tension in the room slowly fluctuated widely. She opened her eyes and saw a thick paper being handed to her by the examiner. It was the most awaited paper. The paper of the questions, the Exam Question Paper.</p><p><i>As she read the instructions on the question paper, fear invited anxiety, and it suddenly took away the floor below her feet, as she descended into a deep hole.</i></p><p>Her sweaty palms reached out for her weapons, and she quickly picked them up. She jumped as high as she could, whilst her heart calmed down and adrenaline rushed in. Her armour’s shine returned as her bright hazel eyes blended in with the heat of the atmosphere blazing with streaks of fire. She was surrounded by four Squads with a total of thirty Cues, each reminded her of the weakness that always made her fill up with regret and lose focus.</p><p>But she gripped her weapon tightly and wrote away whatever she knew. What she thought never mattered to anyone anyway, the ones who were superior knew her better, as they brainwashed her childhood friends and tricked them into becoming robots. They always insisted that she must get through the <i>exams, </i>the <i>internals, </i>and the <i>assignments.</i> That she needed them to grow into an ideal person, deemed to be fit only by them. As she drew, each of her numbers slowly lost their meaning, but she constantly remained thoughtless, going into a state of trance which others saw to be acidic. She answered each question like a mindless freak and became the first one to leave the room. She was the only one whose armour shined in the illusion.</p><p><i>She lived in a system that rewarded the students with intellectual superiority but failed to recognise their creativity within.</i></p>",

All around him, the hustle bustle of life continued, yet he was in his own world. It was a long and arduous journey, some parts forgotten, some cherished.</p><p>From daily revision to panicking one night before exams. From waking up regularly at 7 to waking up at 8:30 for an 8 o’clock class. From enjoying the fest to enjoying the company of his friends at the fest. He'd become well versed in wildlife too, learning not to eat food near the monkeys, yet giving them to the dogs who radiated innocence. Not to mention mastering how to spot peacocks from afar, and snakes from up close.</p><p>As he took a stroll down memory lane, he realised he had changed drastically; for good or for worse, he was yet to find out. It was like rowing into a thick dark mist, unaware of the abyss beyond. Fear struck his heart, resonating with his entire soul, shaking him down to the core. And yet on he rowed.</p><p>He didn't know which version of himself he missed more, whether he lived in memories or moments. But he knew he had lived, and that never failed to put a smile on his face. And as he stepped out into the world, he was ready, with an arsenal of experience at his disposal.</p><p>Regrets he had, but too few to be worth any mention. Mistakes he had made, yet never repeated. Procrastinated he had, but isn't pulling three all nighters the definition of passion?</p><p>This second home had given him many firsts. He too had found where he belonged in this crowd of confused citizens, and as he stood on this precipice, he was ready to take a leap of faith.</p><p>People can question his success, they can question the very definition of success, but when he has these memories etched in his mind, he knows he has the will to face the world. And that is all he needs.</p><p>Pray not the mountains in front of you fall. Pray you have the courage to climb them and rise.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>What was the turning point in your life where you decided to quit your job and start preparing for civil services? What were the hardest parts during your preparation?</strong></p><p>I had an inclination towards civil services since the very start. I can not pinpoint the exact moment when it all started. It was a gradual process, in which my inclination grew into determination.</p><p>I began serious preparations after 2016. In 2018, I took the exam with a rigorous and thorough preparation backing me.</p><p>Studying the content from standards sixth to tenth was definitely the hardest part for me - I felt infantilised when I went through it. Of course, the fact that you are barely earning during the preparation period and are dependent on your parents’ money adds an additional level of pressure.</p><p>I believe that if one is not mature enough to handle this pressure then, I am afraid, one does not belong in the field of civil services. Down the line, one will encounter greater pressure during their stint in the services.</p><p><strong>What's your vision for after you finish your training? What are the reforms or some certain things that you plan to do differently?</strong></p><p>Being a part of IPS, I will talk about my department. I think that the police needs to have more community connect with the people. The usual perception that the society possesses about the police is that it is violent, corrupt, and supports the rich. This is incorrect and needs to be changed. The police officers need to engage directly with the people and the community they are serving.</p><p><strong>Did you always plan on selecting IPS, or were you interested in IAS and IFS as well? How do you feel about the fields?</strong></p><p>I was always inclined towards IAS as my family has an administrative background. However, I am equally happy in the IPS. After all, the uniform has its own charm.</p><p>My father served as the joint secretary to the Government of Jharkhand. When my father took the Civil Services Examination, the competition was less fierce. There were fewer graduates appearing for the exam. A lot has changed since then. Currently, 7-8 lakh aspirants take the exam. It takes a lot to even aspire for this. Now, everyone has access to the content online. Everyone is able to read the relevant content.</p><p>In the end, it all comes down to how well you grasp the content and apply it during the exam.</p><p><strong>What are some tips to help youngsters abstain from social media during their preparation?</strong></p><p>People often avoid quitting social media due to their anxiety or the fear of missing out. I would like to very categorically say that you don’t miss out on anything at all.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it works the other way round. When you quit social media, you gain insight on many ‘real’ aspects of life, which you would have otherwise missed out.</p><p>Once you are aware of this fact, you can easily quit social media. It is just a matter of self-control.</p><p><strong>What would you like to say to the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>I firmly believe that all of you are in a place that acts as the perfect launchpad. It can launch you in any direction that you want. Don’t just learn in this period, learn how to learn. The coming times will be harder and DTU will prepare you well for that.</p>",

Super start to an over and the ball just kept going up.”</i></p><p>The story of one of the greatest players of the game began on a similar note in his debut batting stint against a bowling attack consisting of McGrath, Gillespie and Brett Lee, whose names are enough to send a shiver down the spine of any batsman.</p><p>An Under-19 WC hero with a staggering domestic record, his international career was off to a flying start with a crucial half century against Australia. He had entered the big leagues and was on the threshold of a fantastic nineteen-year long journey.</p><p><strong>13th July 2002:</strong></p><p><i>“Another sweet shot. No more than a dismissive flick off his legs and the ball arcs deep into the crowd”</i></p><p>India had lost early wickets and needed a solid partnership in the Natwest Series encounter with England on foreign soil. India needed a hero and that’s when he proved himself and built a solid 121-run partnership with Mohd. Kaif to lead India to an unforgettable win. He knocked the English bowlers all over the ground and made the monumental 325-run chase seem like child’s play.</p><p><strong>22nd September 2007:</strong></p><p><i>“He’s hitting them everywhere. He steps to the leg side and sends the ball flying over the ropes.”</i></p><p>He was in tremendous form and had become unstoppable when on the pitch. He had accurately earned his reputation and was a key player in the Indian squad for the inaugural edition of the T-20 World Cup.</p><p>Facing Australia in the semi-finals, the man in form unleashed his fury on Symonds and Clarke, hitting them for boundaries with a brilliant array of shots. He went on to score 70 off 30 deliveries and India marched into the final of the tournament with ease.</p><p><strong>15th December 2008:</strong></p><p><i>“The bowler changes sides but the result remains the same. He steers it over backward point and it clears the boundary again.”</i></p><p>He was performing spectacularly in every format of the game. He was the most complete player in the squad with finesse in his shots, grace in his fielding and depth in his bowling. It came as no surprise when he took the centre stage with the legend Sachin Tendulkar in the run chase versus England, during the first test match of the series. He played an essential role and flawlessly scored an unbeaten 85 in the second innings to once again successfully help his team grab a climacteric triumph.</p><p><strong>24th March 2011:</strong></p><p><i>“Down on one knee and knocked over midwicket. It went high, disappearing in the night sky before dropping with a thud in the ecstatic crowd.”</i></p><p>India were again put through an arduous challenge as they faced a fearless Australian side in the quarters of the 2011 World Cup. Having the tournament of his life, he once again stepped up to score an unbeaten half century against the then current champions. His thunderous roar after scoring the winning runs was enough to let the world know that if you mess with the bull, you will get the horns. India went on to the lift the coveted trophy and he was named Player of the Tournament.</p><p><strong>19th January 2017:</strong></p><p><i>“It was meant to be a maximum the moment it left his bat. It has been achieved for the first time in a T-20 international. Six sixes in an over!”</i></p><p>He was always meant to achieve astonishing feats in his career. Even after being diagnosed with cancer, this man was not ready to give up. Just like any other bad delivery, he shot it out of the park and scripted to what was, and probably will remain the greatest comebacks in the history of the sport.</p><p>After a few stints since the recovery, he showed his prowess in the second ODI against England, scoring his first century since the 2011 World Cup while ruthlessly bludgeoning the English bowlers alongside M.S. Dhoni.</p><p>As the cricket superstar calls it a day, his glorious moments will forever remain etched in the heart of every cricketing fan for generations to come. He will forever be remembered as the man who delivered whenever his country needed him, the lionhearted hero hailing from Punjab- <i><strong>Yuvraj Singh</strong></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(Italicised text credits- www.espncricinfo.com)</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. A.R. Kulkarni, Assistant Professor, Electrical Engineering Department, on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Electric Vehicles and optimising the traffic flow in DTU and beyond.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What specifically motivated you to take on this challenging project of Traffic Optimization?</strong></p><p>For the everyday traveller, Delhi’s traffic jams are a nightmare. One of the major contributors to this issue are the traffic signals with fixed timings and the lack of real-time analysis of traffic. In Delhi, Siemens did a similar pilot project for traffic-actuated signals in Anand Vihar some years ago. In Central Delhi as well, a project was initiated for the same, years ago. Other than these two initiatives, the only city in India to boast about traffic-actuated signals at four major junctions is Bangalore. Thus on recognizing the rising need for an Intelligent Transport System, we decided to work on real-time controlled traffic lights using feedback generated from Bluetooth sensors.</p><p><strong>Could you explain a little more about the project for our readers?</strong></p><p>The controlling and actuation requires a feedback mechanism which is absent in most transport systems. Whatever feedback mechanism we have is through inductive loops and that has only been installed in very few places. Other than this, Traffic Cameras can also be used for traffic control, but the Delhi Traffic Police only uses them for monitoring. Thus we thought to develop a mechanism for real-time control of traffic lights using Bluetooth sensors. This project was initiated almost two and a half years ago and depended on the success of two sub-projects. The first one was to create a Bluetooth device capable of identifying all Bluetooth devices in its vicinity. Even though there are sensors available abroad that cater to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, they are extremely costly – the cost of one sensor starts from 2 Lakh Rupees. So the main task was to develop a low-cost alternative for this sensor and we achieved success when we were able to create a Bluetooth sensor that would cost merely 10,000 Rupees inclusive of all costs. The second part of the project involved the creation of a website where all the data would be collected and analysed and based on that data we would be able to predict the green-time for each traffic light on a real-time basis in sync with current traffic on road. The main plan was to implement this project on a large scale, but first we needed to test our device on a set of consecutive signals (at least 3 in line) to see if we could control the central signal by taking in information on both sides – upstream and downstream. As a part of the project, we installed a traffic signal at the main circle of DTU so that the students could gain the first-hand experience of the system before working on real-time traffic control.</p><p><strong>What were some of the challenges you faced in the process?</strong></p><p>The biggest challenge was the collection of data. The Government makes no active continuous effort to collect real-time traffic data. They only collect data as and when required with the help of CRRI (Central Road Research Institute).</p><p><strong>During the course of the project, as you mentioned, you worked on the data generated from the Rohini Area (Rithala to Madhuban Chowk). Do you have any plans of expansion to any other major traffic points in Delhi?</strong></p><p>Traffic data collection is a huge exercise and requires a lot of volunteers to go and collect the required data. My students started with the Rohini Area where they worked on the stretch from Netaji Subash Place to Rithala which has 6-7 signals. Let’s see where this project takes us now. As I stated before that the main goal is expansion, but with the current resources in hand and given that Electrical Engineering students working under me had to take on roles of Civil Engineering students as well, we have to look at all the factors before finalizing another area.</p><p><strong>Would you like to make this a multi-disciplinary project in the coming future?</strong></p><p>ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) has multi-disciplinary requirements. You need electrical engineers for the circuitry, computer engineers for the programming, data collection and analysis and civil engineers for the road mapping, physical reforms, installments etc. Everyone has a role to play in it, and I would like to encourage all students are interested in working on such a system to join this venture.</p><p><strong>Any particular fields student should explore before joining?</strong></p><p>Students can try getting some experience on doing traffic analysis by manual methods, gaining knowledge about video analytics, image processing as these fields would be very helpful in expanding the scope of our project from Bluetooth to video.</p><p><strong>Besides ITS, you have also been working on Electric Vehicles, could you tell us something about that initiative?</strong></p><p>We are in the process of developing an Electric Vehicles Lab in our department. Here we will mainly be working on two aspects – Retrofitting, which involves converting old vehicles to electric vehicles and secondly, designing a low-cost and sustainable electric vehicle as an intra-campus transport. For the latter, we have a tie-up with HBSS and the venture is being led by <strong>Prof. Uma Nangia</strong>. HBSS is providing us with e-rickshaws which have been employed in the campus offering free rides to the students inside the campus.</p><p><strong>What is the immediate future you see for this initiative?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, we want to focus on data generation. We want to know the current Origin-Destination (OD) demand, so we can employ our findings to understand how many vehicles are required in DTU and then cater to that requirement. As of now, we have 4 e-rickshaws in the campus and we are in the process of converting an Omni Van to an electric vehicle as well which should be completed by the students in another 3-4 months. DTU Alumnus <strong>Mr. Suresh Raheja</strong> has also provided us with a convertible e-rickshaw. There is also a battery car in the university on which the students are currently working to resolve the many wiring and steering issues that have risen over the years it was lying idle.</p><p><strong>Are there any more ITS initiatives student can work on?</strong></p><p>Besides the Traffic Lights System and the Electric Vehicles System, we are also planning a project on Traffic Violations like wrong-side driving in DTU. A camera has already been installed on the Main Gate and a few more cameras are to be installed through which the students can work on various techniques of traffic violation detection, before taking this project to a bigger level.</p><p><strong>What are your plans to optimize the current traffic control system you have developed?</strong></p><p>We plan to create a traffic test-bed in DTU by installing more traffic signals in DTU primarily around the admin block, the science block and the mechanical department. This will be part of our experimental control where we can stop the traffic at different checkpoints and regularize it at the main entrance and exit, keeping in mind the traffic during fests and counselling sessions. We are doing this with the help of Envoys Electronics who are providing us with the hardware of traffic lights to be installed in DTU.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Would you like to say anything about your journey so far and your experiences with the team?</strong></p><p>I'm very thankful to my team for their continuous efforts and their hard work. It is because of them that this project has seen the light of the day and I hope they continue to put in their best in the future also!&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>By Anoushka Raj, ENE, 1st year, and Srishti Mittal, PSCT, 2nd year</i></p><p>Scrolling through our friends’ Instagram stories a few days ago, we noticed a rather disturbing trend. Every single story sang the same refrain: a screenshot of the Delhi CM’s announcement about making metro and bus travel free for women, and a caption condemning it. While the move has its pros and cons, we were surprised to see that everyone had one common problem with it: <i>“How is this equality? This is just sexism in the name of feminism.”</i> Girls usually added in, <i>“I don’t support this, I can pay for my metro ticket.”</i></p><p>The girls who said that, we agree with them. As women coming from upper-middle class families with parents who have prioritized and supported our education every step of the way, we definitely don’t need this subsidy. Luckily for us and every ‘elite’ woman who thinks that the scheme is a setback for feminism and gender equality, the subsidy is optional; if we wish to pay for our tickets, we can do so. This is the basic principle of the working of subsidies, and is a way for responsible citizens to ensure that the scheme reaches its target audience.</p><p>Upper-class women with access to social media often undermine a large class of women who have still not reaped the full benefits of feminism. Amidst the hue and cry of the internet, the plight of those who face bitter adversities are often overshadowed. At one end are the people who will fight tooth and nail at any sign of positive discrimination, jumping onto the wagon of <i>if women are equal, they don’t need any ‘privileges’</i>. The other end is that of ‘radical’ feminists, who view any policy that favours women with rose coloured glasses and fail to condemn even the most obvious of flaws. One gets torn between the two and the internet becomes a hive of petty squabbles rather than being a collective voice of dissent for the needy.</p><p>It is ironic that a form of public transport - the Delhi Metro, which was meant for everyone - has long been an elitist form of transport that divides the rich and the poor. Gender further intensifies this divide, since the cost of commuting is just another reason why women are discouraged from stepping out to work or study. Making commuting easier and affordable urges poorer women to go out more, creating an outlet for reaching out to less well-off sections and providing them with equal opportunities.</p><p>We know what you’re thinking - “why don’t they just take the bus?”</p><p>Because the metro is safer: there is a ladies’ coach, and there’s a set route that the driver cannot change at will. The Chief Minister said that he expects the number of female commuters using the metro to go up by 1 lakh. This reasonable and rational ratio increases the visibility of women, which is a tangible change in a way that installing CCTVs and providing pepper sprays is not. Surveillance does not necessarily guarantee safety; the strength lies more in numbers.</p><p>Another common refrain is, <i>“what about the men who can’t afford to use the metro?” </i>While there are many social groups (including persons with disabilities and students from the economically weaker sections) who would benefit from this subsidy were it extended to them, the current focus of the scheme is on making Delhi safer for <i>women</i>. Although men aren’t completely safe on the streets either, often becoming victims of molestation and sexual violence, they certainly have a higher number of safe spaces than women do.</p><p>However, the timing seems to be rather strategic, keeping in mind the forthcoming elections. The rules of implementation have not been put in place, which could eventually lead to a haphazard logistical nightmare.</p><p>Also, the scheme does not take into account the transgender and nonbinary communities. From leering men in the general coaches to reproachful women in the ladies’ coach, transgenders already face a multitude of issues in the Delhi Metro, and little has been done to address their concerns. The move could ostracise them even further.</p><p>A major issue is the financial viability of the subsidy. Former Delhi Metro chief E. Sreedharan, popularly called the ‘Metro Man’ for his contribution towards setting up the Delhi Metro, strongly opposes the scheme, saying that he had taken a firm decision that no one would be given travel concession. This was done in order to maximise revenue, so that the Metro would make sufficient surpluses to pay back the loans taken from Japan International Cooperation Agency.</p><blockquote><p>\"If the Delhi government is so keen to help lady commuters, I would suggest Delhi government can pay directly to the lady commuters the cost of their travel rather than make travel free on the Metro,\" Sreedharan said.</p></blockquote><p>Financial viability and the misuse of taxpayer’s money still seem to be legitimate problems with the scheme, as is overcrowding. It might take months to show effect and by then, we may have a totally new government. Since the DMRC’s losses will be reimbursed by the Delhi Government, it is true that the government will be gambling with a major chunk of the taxpayer’s money. However, it is ironic that the people who wholeheartedly accepted spending &nbsp;₹2,989 crore on a giant statue are calling this move a waste of taxpayer’s money.</p><p>The problem of handling the safety situation by making a system of public transport free is novel and perhaps has no previous model to bank on, but might still be effective if properly implemented. In an FAQ shared by the Delhi Government, they state “More women in any public spaces automatically makes those spaces safer for women.” This is a step towards helping women reclaim public spaces, and we, for one, welcome this spirit wholeheartedly.</p><p><i><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The views expressed in this article belong solely to the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of DTU Times or Delhi Technological University. &nbsp;</i></p>",

    "body": "<blockquote><p>I have always wanted to work on projects that have a wide-ranging impact on society.</p></blockquote><p><i>DTU Times interviewed Alankrit Tomar, EP, Class of 2019, who got admitted into the Ph.D. program at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin.</i></p><p><strong>What was the main motivation behind choosing to pursue a PhD rather than a conventional Masters Degree?</strong></p><p>A Masters degree serves as an ideal platform to gauge what your interests are, and whether your interests in your field of research is high enough to pursue a PhD in the same field. I was sure of the field I wanted to pursue research in and was also willing to undertake the plunge of 5 years of extensive research. Hence, the decision of pursuing a PhD degree.</p><p>Also, the primary focus in a Masters degree is undertaking necessary courses relevant to your course but a PhD degree primarily entails undertaking a research project which would eventually contribute towards a thesis. Since my ultimate aim was to pursue a full-fledged project in my field of interest, I decided to apply for a PhD degree.</p><p>So these two factors motivated me to go for a PhD degree and not an MS.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to pursue research in your field, given that most of the engineering students go for placements or a management degree?</strong></p><p>The field of research that I am interested in has varied applications in the field of medicine, communications etc. I have always wanted to work on projects that have a wide-ranging impact on society. Pursuing a career in the field of research would enable me to work on technologies that could make a tremendous positive impact on society in the coming years. So, this served as an inspiration to me.</p><p><strong>How would you differentiate PhD and Masters applications, in terms of procedure, academic achievements, references etc?</strong></p><blockquote><p>PhD applicants should undertake projects specific to the field that they are interested in.</p></blockquote><p>There is no significant difference in the application process for the PhD applications and the Masters' applications.<br><br>The competition pool for PhD applicants is tougher than the Masters' applicants since for a PhD program, both Masters and Bachelors degree holders apply whereas for a Masters program, mostly Bachelor degree holders apply. This being said, an ideal PhD applicant's profile will most probably have publications whereas a Masters applicant's profile might not. Hence, it is always good to have publications on your profile if you aim to apply for PhD programs. But again, this isn't a hard and fast rule.</p><p>Secondly, PhD applicants are expected to be clear about the field of research that they are interested in, and should undertake projects specific to the field that they are interested in. For Masters degree applications, some amount of generic undergraduate research work should do.</p><p>Thirdly, it is often seen that PhD applicants have Letters of Recommendation from professors under whom they have worked on research projects. The recommendations from such professors are quite specific in terms of the qualities of the applicant that they think helped him/her to achieve the tasks on that project. Such detailed LoRs can be very helpful for the application. For the Master's program, applicants usually take LoRs from their research project supervisors and even their professors under whom they have undertaken courses.</p><p>Again, all things said above are from a general trend that I have noticed and it is not rigid.</p><p><strong>How important are extracurriculars in any foreign university application?</strong></p><p>I believe that extracurricular activities should be undertaken by students irrespective of whether those would help their chances of getting admission abroad. Taking part in such activities leads to the all-round development of one’s personality and serves as a good break from the hectic routine. But yes, extracurricular activities surely do add substance to one's profile for foreign university applications. It serves as a good metric to judge how well a student manages his/her studies and other activities.&nbsp;<br>So irrespective of whether you would be applying for PhD programs or Masters programs, do take out time for the numerous activities that are held in college such as quizzing, dramatics, etc.</p><p><strong>What would you advise your juniors, who are aspiring to follow a similar path in research? How can they increase their chances of success?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The GRE general exam, the GRE subject exam and the TOEFL should not be taken lightly.</p></blockquote><p>First and foremost, contrary to what students usually get to hear, I would like to stress the fact that your grades are a huge factor for your admission to foreign universities. A good CGPA can also compensate for the lack of research projects on one's CV. No one should feel disheartened over low grades but instead should start working towards performing to their best potential from that moment onwards.</p><p>Secondly, the students who are interested in going abroad for higher studies should undertake research projects, albeit generic ones, as early as possible. They should make full use of the summer break as well as the winter break to undertake projects. It is advisable to identify your interests and find professors at our university who are working in that field and consequently start some projects under them. Once that is done, students should apply for the numerous research internships across the world and gain experience. In this process, one should try to publish their work for conferences and journals. Publications strengthen one's profile. For those unsure of what they want to pursue research in should try to undertake online courses to know more about what interests them. Talking to seniors helps and might give the confidence necessary to take steps in the right direction.</p><p>Thirdly, managing time is one very crucial thing that will not only come in handy regarding college admissions but is also a good trait to imbibe, in general. That being said, I would stress on preparing the Statement of Purpose (SoP) well 2 months in advance, so that there is enough time to refine it by discussing it with seniors and friends. It is advisable to have a general timeline for the few months before the application deadlines which encompasses when to give the GRE and the TOEFL. That being said, the GRE general exam, the GRE subject exam and the TOEFL should not be taken lightly as a low GRE or TOEFL score could be detrimental to one's application.</p><p>Lastly, and most importantly, never hold yourself back from helping someone who needs help not only with their college applications but even about stuff that is bothering them otherwise.</p><p>Good Luck!</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Srishti Verma, PSCT, Class of 2019, who got admission in HEC Paris as an MIM candidate.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What role would you say your branch played in making you choose to pursue your current course for post graduation?</strong></p><p>Well, to be honest, my branch didn't have that much of an effect in choosing my PG course, but the extra curricular activities I participated in did help me in choosing a career path. Throughout college life, I have been associated with various societies in which I took on managerial roles. PSCT was never my first choice. for that matter, even engineering wasn't a preference because after 12th I wasn't really sure what i wanted to pursue. But through these 4 years, having participated and managed events, I realised that i wanted to do something related to management, and hence MIM. One positive aspect I would say the branch had was that there was not much pressure of studies as compared to other branches, so I had more time at hand to explore outside my field as well as devote proper time for GRE preparation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think DTU helped you in choosing your current career?</strong></p><p>DTU has helped me immensely in choosing my career, as I was exposed to a multitude of activities here. DTU has many societies to choose from and the scale at which the events are organised is huge. Not just that, it is a brand name in itself. I had myself chosen DTU for the sake of its brand name, and the same has helped me secure admission in HEC as well. The colleges abroad place a major importance on the college you are from and its image.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the procedure to apply for a B-School abroad and what are the major differences in B-Schools in our country and abroad?</strong></p><p>To apply for B-school abroad, you need to start really early as it is a very time consuming process. After writing GMAT/GRE, you need to start with your application which is mostly Essays/SOP and LoRs in addition to IELTS/TOEFL. You also need to make sure that your scores have been received by the school in time before the deadline. The first round generally starts in September, so you need to be ready with your applications for the schools you are applying to by the deadline. Though there are many admission rounds that go on till around April, but it’s better to apply in the 1st round itself, since it gives you the best chance due to lesser competition. &nbsp; Also, you would have to work on your essays/SOPs repeatedly to make them perfect, and each school has different requirements. The whole process takes up a lot of time, so it’s best to start as early as possible to give it your best shot.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the difference in B-schools here and abroad is concerned, it mostly depends on what your aim is. If you aim to settle in India itself, then B-school here would be the way to go since it would give you a much better insight into Indian market. It the aim is to settle abroad and have a global career, then B-school abroad is the way to go since it would give you insight into the international markets. According to me, the practical exposure that I’d get, in addition to studying with people from all over the world and understanding their mindsets, is something very important. Here in DTU, even though we have so many resources at hand, there are not enough practical applications of what we study in classroom, which according to me is a major drawback. I feel practical knowledge is the main aspect of what we learn. In this aspect, B-schools abroad fare very very well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How should one plan his engineering days and prepare for GMAT?</strong></p><p>Since I took GRE (I was keen on applying for masters only, not MBA), I can help there. To start with the preparation, you first need to know what all areas you need to work on. For that, I suggest to take a diagnostic test first. It’ll help you to know what your weak areas are. For me, Vocabulary was the lagging point. I started working on it by October of my 3rd year. I worked on it daily (even if 20-30 min) till summer break after 3rd year, and then in July I took the exam. In GRE, Quant is pretty decent-10th level. You just need to practice a bit to avoid silly mistakes. For the exam preparation, keeping the vocabulary aside, according to me 1.5-2 months are enough to get familiar with the exam pattern, sections, question types, answering methods, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>GMAT is more grammar based than vocabulary, but the Quant there is a bit difficult than GRE. So, If Maths is your strong area, I suggest to take GMAT. (MIM accepts both GRE/GMAT).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which other schools did you apply to and what led you to choose HEC?</strong></p><p>I applied to LBS and HEC Paris only, both in the first round of admissions. I couldn't give in much time for LBS application since I was focusing more on HEC’s and the LBS deadline was much before. (This is why, start early!) The plan was to apply to LSE too as they have rolling admissions, but I got an offer from HEC first, so I did not apply to any other school.&nbsp;</p><p>HEC’s MIM course curriculum was perfect for me, as it has an optional gap year in between the 2 years of studies for internship purposes. Not only that, France’s post-study visa regulations are quite lenient in comparison to UK (LBS, LSE). It allows us Indians to stay for over 2 years after studies, whereas in UK it is just 4 months. This was a major factor in my preference of school.</p><p>And of course, it’s in Paris! What more could one want? :P</p><p><strong>What all challenges did you overcome during your journey to get into HEC and what message would you like to give future aspirants?</strong></p><p>Firstly, the GRE prep was a major challenge for me, as I needed to score as much as I could since my college GPA wasn't that great. So, to cope up, I had to give it my all for GRE. After that, the next hurdle was the applications. When you are applying in multiple schools, you need to prepare different applications for each. All have different requirements. Some would require a long SOP, some 2-3 long essays and here in HEC’s case - 8 short essays. So drafting them all accordingly by around the same deadlines, sending LORs to each university through multiple professors, sending scores etc, it’s quite a task! And you will not just work on them once, you would have to edit them again and again for perfection, and for that you need a lot of time. So my advice is “Start Early”. Take the exam as early as possible so that you have ample of time to decide on the schools and prepare the applications accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing I would suggest is that don’t compare your profile to others. There is no point since everybody is different. As for me, every senior I talked to regarding admissions said that I needed a stellar GPA to get the best school. But I did not pay much attention to that. Rather, I tried to cope up in GRE and got admission in one of the world’s best schools for MIM with an average 7.6 GPA! So, it does not matter- each profile is different. I believe that if you are truly passionate about something and you work equally hard, you will achieve it. All the best! :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mansi Agarwal, COE, Class of 2020, who secured a Research Internship at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University through the SN Bose Scholars program and the Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program by CMU.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>The general perception of research is that it is a long and trying road and does not offer a quick payoff, which people are often interested in. Considering this, what made you pick research over other options you might have had? What do you hope to achieve at the end of your journey?</strong></p><p>I have always been an inquisitive soul. It is this curiosity that urges me to push my boundaries. The reason why I like to research is that it helps me to quench this thirst of knowing more and doing more than what is thought of us. I do not know what the future holds for me but I want to delve deeper into understanding technology and make a constructive and commendable contribution to the society at large through the knowledge acquired in these fields. What Alan Turing once said keeps me going, “We can see only a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty that needs to be done.”</p><p><strong>What ignited your interest in this particular field of research? Having an interest in something and actually pursuing the field are two different things. What edged you to start your research?</strong></p><p>It initially began with working on small projects to get a good command over the field. The zeal to do these projects came from the fact that all of them somehow, helped the society. I believe when chosen to its full potential, Artificial Intelligence can help save the world and that is what urged me to pursue this field of research.</p><p><strong>What are some necessary steps any individual needs to take in order to be eligible for your particular scholarship/s? What stage is ideal to start preparing for them?</strong></p><p>As clichéd as it sounds, but the first step would be to breathe and believe in yourself. I have been in your shoes and seeing articles about your seniors might intimidate you.&nbsp;</p><p>The “ideal” steps, in general, would be to first decide what you want to pursue. How do you do that? Explore, explore and explore. Your first year should involve engaging in a lot of events, both technical and non-technical. Communicate with a lot of seniors and do not hesitate to ask.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have determined the field of research (don’t worry, you can always change), try working with small projects on your own. There are a lot of resources online. Next, you should look for professors (not necessarily from our university) whose interests align with yours and drop them a mail talking about your previous work, maybe about an idea that you have, or an ongoing project that you would like to work on. A good mentor can mould your path to success. A lot of seniors might say that the GPA is not that important, but I highly disagree. There has not been one interview where I have not been asked for my GPA. So, along with your research, do focus on your college curriculum too. Keep an eye on the scholarships and opportunities you want to seek and lastly, do not lose hope. Enjoy the success, embrace the failures. Speaking from experience, things somehow, eventually always work out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would help improve the chances of aspiring juniors looking to land a meritorious research internship? Are there any specific resources and skills you would like to recommend to aspirants?</strong></p><p>I have gained invaluable experience by working with extremely sharp, motivated and hardworking scientists. So, my advice would be to work on a lot of projects! It is important to know the theory but you can only enhance your skill-set by coming up with innovative solutions to those dreadful errors. The resources depend on your field of research, so the best way to go about it is to ask your peers and seniors.</p><p><strong>How has your experience been so far at the internship? How would you compare it with corporate internships?</strong></p><p>Working with some of the best and the most experienced minds in the fields of AI and Robotics has helped me shape my thinking to be better able to contribute to the research community. The learning curve has been amazing and I learnt something new every day. Along with the research, I also got the opportunity to be a part of awesome workshops hosted by companies like DJI and Ubtech which are pioneers in the field of Robotics.</p><p>I prefer research internships over corporate ones as the former permits me enough flexibility to try something new and innovative and not confine myself to the company’s rules and regulations.</p><p><strong>Where does DTU lack in terms of research? What, according to you, can be improved here to keep pace with other leading research institutes?</strong></p><p>One problem I faced was the lack of awareness. People come to know about the opportunities when it’s too late. One way to deal with this could be using the university’s social media portals to update everyone about the deadlines. We could also form small research groups mentored by Professors of our University and have research-based labs where students can work and grow.</p>",

    "slug": "cern-809",
    "body": "<p><i><strong>Chirag Arora, Engineering Physics, Class of 2019, shares his experience of attending the Openlab Summer Student Program at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.</strong></i></p><p>It all started back in December 2017 when I was looking to get undergraduate research experience to supplement my resume to get into the master’s programme at a top university. Previously, I had been a part of the <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> programme for two years in a row, taking turns both as a <strong>student</strong> and as a <strong>mentor</strong>. Therefore, I thought a research experience would be a great diversification of my resume.&nbsp;</p><p>A new year had started, and so did another semester at the university. I knew I had to do an internship after this semester to fulfil the requirements of my bachelor’s degree. So finding a research-based internship sounded like a good idea to me. And since even the best institutions in India offer a sloppy research experience, I had to aim for an international internship. I would like to tell you I was already rejected my <strong>Mitacs</strong> by this point. Selection in Mitacs is aggressively dependent on <strong>GPA</strong>. Majority of people who make it through are nine-pointers, whereas I barely crossed the eligibility threshold. Reality hit hard, and it didn’t take long for me to realize this was the case with every other international research internship. Of course, it had to be competitive! What was I thinking?!&nbsp;<br>Fortunately, my quest for finding an international internship introduced me to the ones available at CERN. Though not research internships, the idea of working at CERN was thrilling and alluring enough for me to put all my efforts into writing a good application that would substantially increase my chances of being selected in the <i><strong>Openlab Summer Student Programme</strong></i><strong>.</strong></p><p>As there was no traditional interview loop involved, what I needed to do was write lengthy paragraphs articulating all the experiences I had accumulated, and all the projects I had worked on. I used to spend a few hours each day fine-tuning my application. As part of the application, I was also required to present two letters of recommendation. I managed to get one from a professor at my college, and another one from my mentor, under whom I had worked during GSoC 2016.&nbsp;<br>It had already been more than a month since the application deadline, and I was imagining selection emails being sent out to the lucky ones. At 19:44 on 5th April, I received a mail with this exact title; <i>“CERN openlab summer student-successful application 2018!”</i>. Yep, it was certain I would be flying to Geneva that summer.</p><p>Since I had arrived in Geneva almost a week before my internship, I grabbed the seemingly excellent opportunity to go backpacking in Rome. Also, during the registration period, I had made acquaintances with some of the fellow Openlab Students over social media. One of my acquaintances had a senior from his university who was now a <i>Technical Student</i> at CERN. The day I came back to Geneva, he invited all Openlab Students for a pool party at his place; not on account of my return though. But I had never imagined in my wildest dreams about having a bash on my very first day in Geneva. A really warm welcome indeed.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://chira.ga/assets/images/roman-colosseum.jpg\"></figure><h4><br><strong>Day one at CERN</strong></h4><p>After completing arrival formalities, I got my personalized CERN ID which could be used anywhere inside CERN to access different buildings and entrances. I reached Building #31, where I was told to meet the IT Secretary. He welcomed me to the IT Department and handed me out a separate key for my office. My workplace was inside my supervisor’s office itself, where he had arranged a desk for me in one of the room’s corners. He invited me to set up my workstation in any way I wanted, but I asserted I would prefer to work on my Mac instead. In response, he gave me a <i>Magic Trackpad</i> and a <i>Thunderbolt-HDMI Adapter </i>to complete my workstation layout. Later that day, incoming students were required to attend an introductory session organized by the program coordinators. And with this, my internship had begun with full swing. Over the next week, many new students would join in, and this would complete the cohort of forty Openlab Summer Students for 2018.</p><h4><strong>Accommodation &amp; Food</strong></h4><p>CERN booked apartments for us in an apart-hotel which was two kilometres away in the neighbouring town of Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France. The apartments were given out on a sharing basis with four students in each. &nbsp;The apartments were fitted with all the basic amenities ranging from a small TV to a kitchenette. Having apartments in the same building allowed us to socialize often and get to know each other better.</p><p>I usually ate a bowl of muesli w/yogurt along with coffee for breakfast. Although light, the breakfast helped me sail through for three hours, after which, I would go to one of the CERN’s Restaurants (<i>R1</i> or <i>R2</i>) to have lunch. The food served in both restaurants is of impeccable quality. I rarely have tasted such scrumptious food elsewhere, at least, not in India. Daily meal at CERN could cost anywhere between 9-13 CHF provided you are not taking coffee breaks in between. The menu is refreshed every day, bringing up new delicacies to our plates.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To reach R2 from Building #31, I used to cross an international border (see below). Technically, Building #31 is located in France while R2 is located in Switzerland. The border is ‘virtual’ as it only exists on maps and papers. There are actually no physical signs of a land border inside CERN. This situation amused me every time I compared it with the insane conditions at the India-Pakistan border.</p></blockquote><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://chira.ga/assets/images/building-31-r2.png\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Transportation</strong></h4><p>Like in any other European city, public transport in Geneva is immaculate. Comprising of both buses and streetcars, the frequency is good and connectivity, wide. There is also, of course, the Geneva airport from where you can fly to any European city you want. Besides that, there is a world-class train system which can be used for day trips to places like Montreux and Lausanne. Trains are not cheap in Europe. And with prior planning, you can fly super cheap on low-cost carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair. As an example, my flight to Rome cost me less than the train I took to Montreux.&nbsp;</p><p>CERN provided us with bikes for a deposit of 100 CHF that would be redeemable upon bike return towards the end of summer. A lot of people did get their bikes stolen because of bad parking decisions. The safest place to park bikes is inside CERN and at your hotel that would usually have a parking area reinforced with metal for this very purpose. This also shows us such petty crimes are not so uncommon even in rich countries like Switzerland and France.</p><h4><strong>Trips and Visits</strong></h4><p>Further, CERN also organized in-house visits for us to its various facilities. We visited the <i>Antimatter Factory</i>, the <i>Computer Centre</i>, the <i>CERN Control Centre</i> (CCC), <i>SM18</i> (SM stands for Superconducting Magnets), the <i>Compact Muon Solenoid</i> (CMS), <i>A Large Ion Collider Experiment</i> (ALICE), <i>A Toroidal LHC Apparatus</i> (ATLAS), and a host of particle accelerators ranging from cyclotrons to synchrotrons I can’t seem to remember the names of. Unfortunately enough, we didn’t get to see the LHC as it was under operation during that period.</p><figure class=\"image image-style-side\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CHlqHgiDfO7qn-8lSusRDpVSqyJVfV3gsU2YtZ3bS1QSJpnubi8cd7aVXIkUMXHA5gPWD2LXa_N2GjnGqwi4fM-R7Itm8_vwxz7xBnnqejkVLr3LkqSPCW3haf2nHs7bzCR6rZ3W\"></figure><p>After a week when all students had arrived, CERN took us to Zurich for visits to<strong> </strong><i><strong>Open Systems</strong></i><strong>, </strong><i><strong>IBM</strong></i> and <i><strong>ETH</strong></i>. The end of Zurich trip marked the start of the best three days I would be having throughout my nine-week stay. While registering for the trip, we had specified we would be finding our way back to Geneva ourselves. So this meant we were free to go anywhere as we pleased from Zurich. We rented a car and embarked on our road trip. The idea was to take the following route: <i>Zurich -&gt; Rhine Falls -&gt; Colmar -&gt; Freiburg im Breisgau -&gt; Colmar -&gt; Lucerne -&gt; Geneva</i>. Since the insurance company would not agree to settle claims if a non-registered driver drove the car, I had to drive it the entire time.</p><blockquote><p>Driving in Europe is an experience that can’t be explained through words. It is a feeling you can only understand by living it yourself. Having driven all my life in India, I found Europe to be the polar opposite. Not just because they drive on the right, but because of the etiquette they follow. Driving in lanes, proper use of turn signals, paying attention to road signs and an aversion to honking incessantly. All of this is nowhere to be seen in India. Things only got better when we entered Germany. Throughout the trip, we were constantly on the lookout for speed limits to avoid getting ticketed. But as soon as we crossed the German border, speed limiting signs just seemed to have vanished. It was a confusing situation at first, and I stayed within the standard limits to be on the safe side. Then it struck me like a jolt of lightning; <i><strong>there are no speed limits on the autobahn.</strong></i> Where else would I be driving if I was driving on a German highway? From that point on, it was only blazing fast speeds for us. There are merely two words to describe what it’s like to drive on the autobahn: <i><strong>orgasmically gratifying</strong></i><strong>.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://chira.ga/assets/images/freiburg-group-photo.jpg\"></figure><p>On Sunday, we headed back to Switzerland, making a stop at Lucerne before leaving for Geneva. When you see enough European cities, you discover a fact; every European city has more or less, the same vibe. It was a long and mundane drive back to Geneva and nothing much exciting happened until we crossed the border back again into France to reach our hotel. As soon as we made our way through the <i>Big Roundabout</i> to enter Saint-Genis-Pouilly, we were greeted by an unusual commotion. Cars were honking in unison with their blinkers on and out of the blue, a biker had just jumped in front of us to perform a burnout. What was going on over here? Out of a sheer stroke of luck for us to witness this celebration, <strong>France had won the World Cup!</strong> It was a stunning sight, and we could only imagine how crazy and wild would folks be going on in big cities like Paris and Marseille.</p><p>My initial plan was to visit a new European city every weekend. But this indeed was a very ambitious plan, and miles away from what actually was achievable. We tried to stretch, but we could have done only so much. By the end, I was able to visit <strong>Milan, Montreux, Annecy, Chamonix, </strong>and<strong> Lausanne</strong> as part of my weekend expeditions.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://chira.ga/assets/images/paragliding-montreux.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>The Work</strong></h4><p>The project you will work on during the summer is highly dependant on the mercy of your supervisor. Even during the application period, there isn’t a list of projects to choose from. Supervisors select only those students they think would be the best fit or their project. Rationally, their decision is based on your resume and what all technologies you have worked on in the past. Profiles of all chosen candidates are sent to the selection committee for screening. The committee has the final say in the selection of any candidate. You may get the impression that <strong>CERN’s selection procedure is highly bureaucratic and unpredictable</strong>. And this is quite true. So don’t feel depressed if you don’t make the cut. Also, since the results are announced late, <strong>it is strongly advisable to have a backup plan</strong>.</p><p>CERN has its own cloud, which is accessible to all employees. Scientists use this cloud to carry out computationally intense tasks and to move around petabytes of data produced by the LHC. CERN uses <i><strong>OpenStack</strong></i>, an open-source framework, to deploy this cloud. And my work was related to a project under the OpenStack umbrella, called <i><strong>Qinling</strong></i>. Qinling is in its early stages of development and is a missing piece of the puzzle that implements <i><strong>Function as a Service</strong></i><strong>.</strong><br>During the initial days, I was trying to wrap my head around OpenStack; creating tens of <i>VMs</i>, building and destroying clusters, and fiddling around with images. After all, I had never worked with OpenStack before. I also configured a fresh OpenStack installation on one of the VMs hosted on the CERN cloud. By doing this, I had literally created a cloud within a cloud. This totally felt like Inception! For a few weeks, I kept on testing Qinling and worked on tasks orchestrated by my supervisor.&nbsp;<br><br>I had also made the first contact with the upstream community via <i>IRC</i> during this period. After completing the testing phase from my end, I set up Qinling for alpha testing, so anyone on my team could use it and provide me with feedback. It is worth mentioning I was ahead of my timeline at this point in time. But a grim realization dawned upon me. I hadn’t coded even a single line since the start of my internship. This internship just couldn’t conclude without me doing some real coding. I had to find a way to serve justice to my time at CERN.</p><p>Since I was now familiar with most of Qinling’s codebase and was already in talks with the upstream community, I realized it was an excellent opportunity to commence some palpable contributions. Sure, I was working with Python for the first time, but on the flip side, there was no better opportunity to learn it. Moreover, communities are always on the lookout for people who can contribute to open-source. With this conviction, I went forward and started working on the Qinling storyboard. This was also the first time ever I got to work with the <i>Gerrit Code Reviews</i> and learnt how seriously unit testing is actually taken in practice.&nbsp;<br><br>The first patch I submitted got rejected straight away due to my naivety. I had failed to check if my patch was passing the unit tests. However, after getting over this minor hurdle, I started contributing to the project at full pace. All in all, I got six patches merged in the Qinling project during the summer. I also made some bug discoveries and suggested some creative features, all of which are now part of the Qinling storyboard. I even contributed for a while after I got back home but was held back by the kind of hardware resources I had and of course, by my studies. I am proud that my contributions didn’t go unnoticed as in Jan’19, I received an invitation to attend the <i>Open Infrastructure Summit</i> that would take place in Denver in May’19.</p><p>Summer students at CERN are pampered throughout the summer. I even know of people who didn’t work at all during the entire internship period. The amount of work you do, in a way, depends totally on you. Your supervisor won’t nag or pester you much. <strong>He is already too busy</strong>. In fact, one of the reasons this internship exists is because teams at CERN don’t have time to test out new projects and services. And so they get students to work for them; this is at least, what I got to know from one of the supervisors towards the end of the internship.</p><h4><strong>Lessons</strong></h4><p>Let’s talk about some lessons I learnt during my stay at CERN.&nbsp;<br>The most important thing I learnt and something that I will always remember would be to lock my computer every time I leave my desk. Not just because this is a good practice, but it also protects you from some mischievous coworkers who would go on the intra-chat and tell everyone that you are providing free ice creams.<br><br>Next, if you are helping your supervisor understand something on their system and you have an urge to point out something on their screen, never ever, touch it. No matter how cool they may seem about it, deep down, they just want to kill you for not knowing the difference between a normal and a touch screen.&nbsp;</p><p>All right, jokes apart, there were also some tangible things I learnt. One of them is to <strong>tackle a problem no matter how daunting it may seem at first</strong>. Working on bite-sized problems and not being afraid of wandering on uncharted territories is the key. Sure, while trying to solve one problem, you may get into many others. You will also break some things and fix the others, but in the end, it’s all worth the effort and is an inherent part of the learning process.</p><h4><strong>Takeaway</strong></h4><p><strong>This is not a conventional internship. </strong>Some students didn’t code even a single line during the entire summer; simply because their projects didn’t require it. Yes, I did manage to submit some patches, but that was purely out of my will to take charge. Further, the project you’ll be working on is decided beforehand, and your supervisor may do little to accommodate your interests. Evidently, this could be a deal-breaker for many. Nevertheless, if you like travelling, and getting to know new people from different cultures and backgrounds, then CERN will offer you an experience like no other. On top of everything, CERN’s brand name does shine bright on your resume and can help you unlock new doors.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://chira.ga/assets/images/openlab-globe-group-photo.jpg\"></figure>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Shreya Gupta, Software Engineering, Class of 2020, who secured a Research Internship at the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, UCLA through the RIPS International Summer Internship program.</strong></i></p><p><strong>The general perception of research is that it is a long and trying road and does not offer a quick payoff, which people are often interested in. Considering this, what made you pick research over other options you might have had? What do you hope to achieve at the end of your journey?</strong></p><p>It’s true that research is a long road, and often an exhausting one. You spend months getting to know a skill and to be eligible to apply it somewhere. If and when you finally get a project, you spend months investigating the topic and struggling around it, then you spend another couple of months trying to present your half-broken half-comprehensible work into a sophisticated paper and finally when you think you are done and submit it to your supervisor, you are told you might have to do the last few steps all over again. I will not sugar-coat it but it is one of the most exhaustive processes ever. It makes you feel emotions you never knew you had; it pushes you to extents you never knew you could go; it makes you do things you never imagined yourself doing; it pushes you absolutely out of your comfort zone and then traps you in itself. It will make you cry, and want to scratch your hair off. But when you finally see your name on the list of accepted papers, it squishes months of hard-work and sweat into that subtle smile. That is the beauty of research.</p><p>I never found purpose in anything I did. I could succeed in them, but never found the reason to come back to them. This is probably why I chose this field. In the end, I want to create and build things that improve the lives of people away from what has been considered the traditional 'development'. I want to build technology that reaches people who are underrepresented in the target audience of the technological advancements made so far. This includes people suffering from neurological diseases like autism who have hampered social well being because of their inability to recognise people. This includes early-stage cancer detection in women at a low cost. This includes finding solutions against rapid environmental changes. Essentially my hope is to apply tech in healthcare and environmental fields using CS and maths to achieve a broader aim.</p><p><strong>What ignited your interest in your particular field of research? Having an interest in something and pursuing the field are two different things. What edged you to start your research?</strong></p><p>In my freshman year, I was introduced to machine learning by my seniors in <i>Pratibimb</i>. I took the famous <i>Coursera</i> course and found it fascinating. I spent my sophomore year understanding and grasping it. I have always been a fan of maths so machine learning seemed the most suited amalgam of CS, tech and maths. I started writing emails and was accepted as a research intern in IITD. Doing the project independently was a mammoth task and made me realise the road is not going to be as simple. But the pain seemed worth it. There has been no looking back since then. I did self-undertaken projects, took courses and read books to further my understanding. It's too soon to say if this field is my calling but it is the closest I have gotten to being able to create applicative technology, so far.</p><p><strong>What are some necessary steps any individual needs to take in order to be eligible for your particular scholarship/s? What stage is ideal to start preparing for them?</strong></p><p>My advice would be to start early, do productive, and constructive research that serves some purpose. I started late and had to squeeze three years' work in a single year, so it was stressful. But the best time to start might be to explore various fields in the <strong>first year.</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Start working under a good professor from the summers of the first year or from the third semester. Keep coding (competitive) and do projects and research in machine learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Try to cover any sub-fields (NLP, CV, AutoML, etc).&nbsp;</li><li>Start applying for summer programs in the late third semester and in the fourth semester and make sure you work under a professor/research group, while doing competitive coding at the same time.&nbsp;</li><li>It is also very important to maintain a good CGPA. For most programs a CGPA above 9 is desirable.&nbsp;</li><li>For some that require you to contact a professor, an 8/8.5+ should also work given you have done quality research.</li><li>Be good at what you do. Start preparing in the third or fourth semester for whatever you want to do.</li><li>My accepting institution is the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA, so maths matters to them. <strong>&nbsp;I can not stress enough on maintaining a good CGPA!</strong></li></ul><p><strong>What would help improve the chances of aspiring juniors looking to land a meritorious research internship? Are there any specific resources and skills you would like to recommend to aspirants?</strong></p><p>Majorly the pointers from the previous answer. Understand what you are doing, read what has been done, be part of good communities (search on <i>Meetup</i>), and contribute to the field generously. Actively start adding content to your <i>GitHub</i> profile. Get your resume reviewed by tons of people.</p><p>Having research experience prior to applying for these programs helps. For resources, you can follow blogs like Google's AI research blog, <i>KDNuggets</i>, <i>machinelearningmastery</i>, and the likes (make Google your best friend). Follow good people, pages, hashtags and topics on <i>LinkedIn</i> to stay updated. I've personally never been a fan of extensive courses and would prefer doing a project over a course any day. It's the hard way but is always more constructive than a course.</p><p><strong>Where does DTU lack in terms of research? What, according to you, can be improved here to keep pace with other leading research institutes?</strong></p><p>I personally feel having better projects, will help DTU and it's students to raise the bar of research. Having real-life industrial and exciting projects helps gain insight into how to apply your skills to create technology that is usable and wholesome. Additionally, it also sets a deadline that makes work efficient.</p><blockquote><p>I personally feel there has to be more dialogue and awareness about the research culture. In my interaction with fellow interns, I found their curriculum courses to be more diverse and in-depth. I think we can benefit from having more electives from the very beginning, with a wider variety of courses. Computer Science branches should ideally have more maths courses because maths is the fundamental of the majority of CS. There can be more seminars and workshops from eminent researchers and mentorship programs.</p></blockquote><p>From my time spent researching in DTU, I have found the atmosphere to be bolstering in your field of choice, whatever that may be. There, however, exists a general lack of research atmosphere - the excitement to create something novel by an amalgam of things. Formulation of a research group that entails more like-minded people and challenges them to solve problems and engage in discussions might be a good starting point for the same. In general, more awareness about research needs to be prevalent from the freshman year itself. Under the current scenario, we have a crowd of lost people, like me, who want to do something but have no clue what or how.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Ashima Suvarna, Computer Engineering, Class of 2020, shares her experience of interning at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton through the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI) Program.</strong></i></p><p>Internship experiences abroad are always amazing. And, when you have the opportunity to work in a lovely country like Canada, it becomes an unforgettable memory. I got an exceptional opportunity to work at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton through the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI) Program. The GRI program is a competitive initiative for international undergraduates from 8 nations including India. Students participate in a 12-week research internship under the supervision of Canadian university faculty members in a variety of academic disciplines, from science, engineering and mathematics to the humanities and social sciences. The internship is completely funded by the organization itself.</p><p><strong>Application and Selection</strong></p><p>It was the beginning of my 5th semester and I set forth for the typical routine of applications and rejections for these highly coveted internship programs all over the world. As a part of it, I applied to Mitacs towards the end of September. The most attractive and unique feature of this program is the exhaustive range of projects it offers in every field and the matching rather than selection procedure to choose the best-suited interns for each project. But earlier it had a CGPA cutoff of 9 which was later lowered to 8 and had it not been for my crazy friend Shreya, I wouldn’t have applied or managed my LoRs two days before the deadline. I interviewed for my project in November (during my semester exams). My professor was incredibly sweet and supportive during the interview and in the first week of January, I woke up to my selection mail. It was a day of incredibly complicated emotions for I was selected for one of my favourite projects and suddenly I realised Canada is very, very far away!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r6BSzqYl5qE3G91Yorw_ZOasVpwVgetfu9rji9lek7e0r24DedTB7JxNUhGvhkyR8rsRRyO8QcB7X9qvG7BskR2o7pHisQ3B3CWnZ-GhLVs3ueGf1F6YQiQlBVQCS1td3hNwJymY\"></figure><p><strong>Canada - the receptive host</strong></p><p>Canada’s famed politeness and kindness are apparent in daily life. People hold the door for the next person out of sheer kindness, they welcome every weird, quaint individual with open arms and go to extreme lengths to help the immigrants. One time, the person in front of me at the concessions counter of a theatre paid for my popcorn simply because he wanted to make someone happy that day. The amount of trust and faith they have in every individual is incredible and one of the major reasons why it is such a lovely country to live in. Summers in New Brunswick are pretty unpredictable with snowfall till early May and scorching heat in July.</p><p><strong>Work in Fredericton</strong></p><p>They have world-class research facilities and present a nurturing environment for new researchers like us in terms of funding and support. My project focused on the preservation of East Algonquian Languages by furthering their research in deep learning. I worked on the project alone while other interns had PhD partners, this made my work a little daunting at first but my professor always insisted on a decent work-life balance. He always said that “Work is secondary to life!”. With good mentorship and encouragement, I have learnt incredible things here, not just limited to my project but also from my fellow interns’ projects.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V5khsm0rgWuDNIRPZAhPiebSmXmyWAwOuqlVmpkTAE1G7N42djabhz_quSWVQ0kjM3J1wbR9rAFuTfYtekz6v4F8vJBeXODx55IFKrP3Dt52HrKrC9Qc4gIBgzGzeHnqi_BfKJix\"></figure><p>My University was in Fredericton a quaint little town on the east coast, not one of the popular big cities like Vancouver or Toronto, in fact, one of my fellow interns told me it sounds like a boring place that people go to after they have lived their life. In retrospect, that was an ill-informed comment, this boring place has the most interesting people I have ever met in my life and given me the best 11 weeks of my life so far.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Living on my own</strong></p><p>As I enthusiastically got on the plane to Canada, I never realised what living on my own actually meant. Cooking, cleaning dishes (my least favourite), laundry, grocery shopping were activities that took up most of my time apart from working. I travelled extensively during my weekends. My friends and I went to Halifax (Nova Scotia) and Quebec City on road trips and Canadian Highways are the most comfortable due to the multiple rest-stops and the interesting people you meet there. I met a little sparrow named Stuart that flew with our car from Halifax to Fredericton. Fredericton is considerably far from all the popular places but it has great connectivity to other maritime provinces (all east coast province are called maritimes) via bus. It is said that Prince Edward Island has Cavendish, the best beach in the world. The backpacking experience to the island was pretty amazing. And, pretty recently I hopped on the bus to visit Montreal, a lovely busy city, a stark contrast to my quiet Fredericton and attended a Hozier concert, one of my favourite artists.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yivdS6f-yzQ78lcfI4vOgEY6qfh-uVfwqm7EZPfWgpwfVpXX2JxRx0Lj6PPPxb5RAdij7Rts3mNAvlTxzYUypax5TyqWQqadmi8UJ5hyBXmM3mEgmYckePHvYIiR854slu4RiM9a\"></figure><p>Being far away from home with a 9-hour time difference is difficult but I think this lovely country makes it very easy. Fredericton feels like home now. Research is amazing primarily due to the creative environment and encouragement of your peers. Random acts of kindness will make you happy every day and the independence is addictive. Mitacs is a great addition to your CV and an incredible experience for you as a person. In the end, I do want to proclaim that Indian food is the best, our spices are worth dying for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some Important Takeaways</strong>:</p><ol><li>No internship or project is too ambitious to apply for, you never know what might be a perfect fit for you and you have to be comfortable with the rejections. A good CGPA will open doors easily for you but a low CGPA would not necessarily close all of them. You just need to take that leap of faith.</li><li>Never send your professor emails on a weekend, he will force you to have fun and chill on weekends if he gets to know you have been working.</li><li>Learn how to cook. Food is so important. We take <i>Aloo Parathas</i> for granted.</li><li>Mitacs is one of the applications that have a very early deadline and a very long application form. The call for interns for Summer 2020 is open now with a CGPA cutoff of 8 and the deadline is 13 September 2019.</li></ol>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Siddharth Basu, SE, Class of 2020, shares his experience of interning at University of Calgary, Alberta through the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI) Program.</strong></i></p><p>It was the long and weary internship season at the start of the fifth semester, everyone dressed in their blue shirts and conversations mostly restricted to discussing how many tests cases they passed the previous day, when I heard a friend talking very highly about a few foreign internship programs like DAAD and MITACS. I was completely in dark about them and knew absolutely nothing at all.</p><p>I went home and did my research and thought of applying, just for the sake of applying as it was in my head at that point in time, not even a distant possibility was there to secure the scholarship. Now contrary to most students wanting to do these internships to strengthen their CV by bagging some research experience before they start off with their postgraduate college applications, my sole driving force at the start was an opportunity to stay abroad for an extended run of two and a half months and spending time with the best minds from across the globe. However, by the end fortunately that did change.</p><p>After securing an on-campus offer, I started my DAAD and MITACS process. I started mailing professors in German Universities expecting that none would revert. To my surprise by the end of September, I had three letters of invitation from Germany. But I knew DAAD usually prefers students with a GPA over 9.4 and I was an early 9 so I concentrated most of my time in the MITACS Globalink Research Internship Programme for Canada. The application deadline was late September for it and I clearly remember procrastinating the application till just two hours before the deadline.</p><p>I hardly knew that it will turn out to be an immaculate experience, and will give me memories to cherish for a long time. It was finally on the 4th of January that I got to know about my selection and that the summers of 2019 won’t be the hot 40-degree summers but rather a summer with sweaters in a country halfway across the world from here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/parangat/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Project</strong></p><p>My internship in the second year at IIM Bangalore really ignited in me an interest in Big Data and Data Science, and how to utilize the immense data which is generated on a daily basis these days to find insights and to develop a productive application out of it. In my project in Canada, I had access to the geo-spatial trajectories of the taxi drivers of three huge Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen) and I developed a route predicting algorithm which incorporates the aspect of human spatial and temporal memory in the prediction part, and not just rely on the shortest distance or time as is the case with Google Maps and other applications.</p><p>I also learnt many new things in order to proceed like managing data on clusters and parallel processing using Spark and Hadoop which go much beyond what we learn in college academics. I believe the biggest takeaway I had in these two different internships is that the best way to learn something is through doing a project in that domain as it helps way more than taking even a dozen courses on that topic.</p><p><strong>The Experience</strong></p><p>My experience so far in the internship has been phenomenal. I had the opportunity to attend meetings and have one-on-one conversations with few of the best professors in the field of Computer Science. In addition to the project I was selected for, I also had the opportunity to work with a corporate client of our laboratory thus giving me access to both the dimensions. The infrastructure I had access to and the level of trust they put in ordinary undergraduate students cannot be matched by any corporate internship in my opinion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/parangat/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the experience of living abroad for a good couple and half months and learning how to cook and do daily chores on your own has been quite some fun. The stipend paid by MITACS also allows you quite some savings which enabled me to go to different cities like Edmonton, Banff, Canmore, Japser, and Yoho National Park. My city, Calgary, had the easiest access to the Rockies which I believe is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Spotting Bears and wildlife especially Grizzlies by the streams while hiking in the Rockies, walking on glaciers and failing at that miserably, watching glacial fed lakes bearing the most brilliant shades of emerald blue, exploring the canyons with walkways by the mountainous rivers with icy cold water and experiencing a snowfall in the month of June has been something I can never forget. The environment you get in Canada where everyone is so supportive and helpful makes you not want to leave this country at the end of your internship. You will also make some really great friends from different countries, and learn a lot from them beyond work and academics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/parangat/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Application Process and Chances of Selection</strong></p><p>The first and foremost step an individual need to take in order to be eligible for foreign internship programs is having a very good GPA, preferably over 9. Most of the famous programs like MITACS and DAAD have a GPA barrier set at 8.5 while applying, but due to the very high volume of good applications they receive it is very tough to get through with a GPA below 9. Along with a good GPA it’s very important to have some good showing in the form of projects, papers or internships in your domain of interest as most of the internships require you to give an interview to the professors under whom you will possibly work, and these are people who've seen and done a lot in their careers so it’s imperative to be a standout in order to work under their tutelage.</p><p>Also, I feel having patience and endurance is also very important as these programs tend to have a very thorough application procedure and usually have very long waiting periods between the application phase and the result declaration phase. In some internships like DAAD you need to first find professors on your own who are willing to take you in their lab for the summers and this process is usually very tiring as most don't reply, and the others send automated rejection mails which can be disheartening at times. In my case, contrary to that, MITACS had a very efficient online portal system and is very easy to figure out once you start your application in September. Also, if you back your GPA with some practical projects and skills in your field, it all will boil down to the interview you give to your professor who in almost all cases will be the best person to gauge your potential. I would suggest to make a list of available internships along with the application deadline so as to apply in a timely and organized manner.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Living Abroad</strong></p><p>MITACS was paying us a fixed stipend for our accommodation but it’s up to you whether you want to live in University premises or outside the campus. Before leaving for Canada, I coordinated with three students from three different BITS campuses and we booked an <i>Airbnb</i> for our duration there. This allowed us savings closed to a 1000$ a month just in accommodation which we used in our travels. I also bought a new bicycle to travel to university and other places nearby, and in no time, we were cycling 15 kilometers a day regularly mostly because of the good weather and nice roads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/parangat/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/parangat/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now coming to food, in the first few days I was surviving mostly on buying food and boiling <i>Maggi</i>. Soon my <i>Maggi</i> stock I carried from India diminished and I had to look elsewhere. There was a group of four girls from India who stayed together and knew how to cook. So, I was mostly found there for dinner every alternate day. Then somehow, I too developed the confidence to go grocery shopping and break eggs. By the end, I was cooking salmon fillets so I think I managed well and now know survival cooking. Although I could buy food everyday with my stipend but then that way, I wouldn’t have any cooking chronicles to tell and it wouldn’t have been as memorable. Prior to leaving I had memorized all the <i>Walmart</i> alleys and that is an achievement given how huge these superstores are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Difference in Research Environment in India</strong></p><blockquote><p>I picked a research internship over the on-campus corporate offer I had.</p></blockquote><p>I think the research environment abroad is a completely different prospect altogether majorly because funding isn't an issue at all, hence making it a very lucrative option without fretting much about the quick pay-off outlook. The kind of projects that students are working on, with access to state-of-art facilities, is unparalleled and in this sense most of the research institutions in India have a long way to go. I picked a research internship over the on-campus corporate offer I had, majorly because of the depth of project I was assigned to do here in Canada and the independence I had in choosing the workflow and deciding the proceedings. I don't think any corporate internship could have given me the opportunity to interact and stay with probably the best minds of eleven different countries and not just working with them but to also learn about different cultures and ways of living. Also the notion of research being a trying path is true in the sense of discipline people maintain towards the work but that doesn't interfere with the work life balance they have, which was true even for my internship as it had no fixed timings or days and mostly depended on my dedication towards the work.

Also, after spending time in Canada I have realized that there is a stark difference in the resources we have even in the good and prominent colleges of our country and the facilities in the western nations.

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Siddharth Basu, SE, Class of 2020, shares his experience of interning at University of Calgary, Alberta through the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship (GRI) Program.</strong></i></p><p>It was the long and weary internship season at the start of the fifth semester, everyone dressed in their blue shirts and conversations mostly restricted to discussing how many tests cases they passed the previous day, when I heard a friend talking very highly about a few foreign internship programs like DAAD and MITACS. I was completely in dark about them and knew absolutely nothing at all.</p><p>I went home and did my research and thought of applying, just for the sake of applying as it was in my head at that point in time, not even a distant possibility was there to secure the scholarship. Now contrary to most students wanting to do these internships to strengthen their CV by bagging some research experience before they start off with their postgraduate college applications, my sole driving force at the start was an opportunity to stay abroad for an extended run of two and a half months and spending time with the best minds from across the globe. However, by the end fortunately that did change.</p><p>After securing an on-campus offer, I started my DAAD and MITACS process. I started mailing professors in German Universities expecting that none would revert. To my surprise by the end of September, I had three letters of invitation from Germany. But I knew <strong>DAAD</strong> usually prefers students with a<strong> GPA over 9.4 </strong>and I was an early 9 so I concentrated most of my time in the <strong>MITACS Globalink Research Internship </strong>Programme for Canada. The application deadline was late September for it and I clearly remember procrastinating the application till just two hours before the deadline.</p><blockquote><p>I hardly knew that it will turn out to be an immaculate experience, and will give me memories to cherish for a long time. It was finally on the 4th of January that I got to know about my selection and that the summers of 2019 won’t be the hot 40-degree summers but rather a summer with sweaters in a country halfway across the world from here.</p></blockquote><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZTrgr8NFQ1Ov-Zqwk7E6j3TvJcE13b6Bx2Gnorl71r364hChdf5UZLf2syF0LvKaspARoV34wC0Skh9qkMNkdy_FfMPC-bg-Uu1pekMHQezsEghqEZKF05cSvdigZP1YA12CP43f\"></figure><p><strong>The Project</strong></p><p>My internship in the second year at <strong>IIM Bangalore</strong> really ignited in me an interest in <strong>Big Data and Data Science</strong>, and how to utilize the immense data which is generated on a daily basis these days to find insights and to develop a productive application out of it.&nbsp;<br>In my project in Canada, I had access to the <strong>geo-spatial trajectories of the taxi drivers of three huge Chinese cities </strong>(Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen) and I developed a <strong>route predicting algorithm </strong>which incorporates the aspect of<strong> human spatial and temporal memory</strong> in the prediction part, and not just rely on the shortest distance or time as is the case with Google Maps and other applications. I also learnt many new things in order to proceed like managing data on clusters and parallel processing using <strong>Spark</strong> and <strong>Hadoop</strong> which go much beyond what we learn in college academics.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I believe the biggest takeaway I had in these two different internships is that the best way to learn something is through doing a project in that domain as it helps way more than taking even a dozen courses on that topic.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The Experience</strong></p><p>My experience so far in the internship has been phenomenal. I had the opportunity to attend meetings and have one-on-one conversations with few of the best professors in the field of Computer Science. In addition to the project I was selected for, I also had the opportunity to work with a corporate client of our laboratory thus giving me access to both the dimensions. The infrastructure I had access to and the level of trust they put in ordinary undergraduate students cannot be matched by any corporate internship in my opinion.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CMISk7JKKHOWRx14vBUN_bYnDLFkSaq1ppkilJ-ic0hZetj3eceUaSQFwS9a4HyX0usMfiANpOl3UPGLMMceiAwqDcjy-M4D4GGOzh9oBBuV9G6kAx2BbNQsR589jHqlLSkCiZd2\"></figure><p>Also, the experience of living abroad for a good couple and half months and learning how to cook and do daily chores on your own has been quite some fun. The stipend paid by MITACS also allows you quite some savings which enabled me to go to different cities like <i>Edmonton, Banff, Canmore, Japser, and Yoho National Park.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>My city, <strong>Calgary</strong>, had the easiest access to the Rockies which I believe is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Spotting Bears and wildlife especially Grizzlies by the streams while hiking in the Rockies, walking on glaciers and failing at that miserably, watching glacial fed lakes bearing the most brilliant shades of emerald blue, exploring the canyons with walkways by the mountainous rivers with icy cold water and experiencing a snowfall in the month of June has been something I can never forget. The environment you get in Canada where everyone is so supportive and helpful makes you not want to leave this country at the end of your internship. You will also make some really great friends from different countries, and learn a lot from them beyond work and academics.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8w8iD3cDoF7Tnc8-lvPVa7ZhUn0excCsoZqwp47e9qeaqX4AkCW7AIDB6niWGNFdecShkcXSzRfmY8aLFOB__LmuNGJisbrMIzYH5c-VflTCAt-xYO9eeswRUEHD18YAErGRdMcZ\"></figure><p><br><strong>Application Process and Chances of Selection</strong></p><ul><li>The first and foremost step an individual need to take in order to be eligible for foreign internship programs is having a <strong>very good GPA, preferably over 9</strong>. Most of the famous programs like MITACS and DAAD have a GPA barrier set at <strong>8.5</strong> while applying, but due to the very high volume of good applications they receive it is very tough to get through with a GPA below 9.&nbsp;</li><li>Along with a good GPA it’s very important to have some good showing in the form of <strong>projects</strong>, <strong>papers </strong>or <strong>internships </strong>in your domain of interest as most of the internships require you to give an interview to the professors under whom you will possibly work, and these are people who've seen and done a lot in their careers so it’s imperative to be a standout in order to work under their tutelage.&nbsp;</li><li>Also, I feel having <strong>patience</strong> and <strong>endurance</strong> is also very important as these programs tend to have a very thorough application procedure and usually have very long waiting periods between the application phase and the result declaration phase. In some internships like DAAD you need to first find professors on your own who are willing to take you in their lab for the summers and this process is usually very tiring as most don't reply, and the others send <strong>automated rejection mails </strong>which can be disheartening at times.&nbsp;</li><li>In my case, contrary to that, MITACS had a very efficient online portal system and is very easy to figure out once you start your application in September. Also, if you back your GPA with some practical projects and skills in your field, <strong>it all will boil down to the interview</strong> you give to your professor who in almost all cases will be the best person to gauge your potential.&nbsp;</li><li>I would suggest to make a list of available internships along with the application deadline so as to apply in a timely and organized manner.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Living Abroad</strong></p><p>MITACS was paying us a fixed stipend for our accommodation but it’s up to you whether you want to live in University premises or outside the campus. Before leaving for Canada, I coordinated with three students from three different BITS campuses and we booked an <i>Airbnb</i> for our duration there. This allowed us savings closed to a 1000$ a month just in accommodation which we used in our travels. I also bought a new bicycle to travel to university and other places nearby, and in no time, we were cycling 15 kilometers a day regularly mostly because of the good weather and nice roads.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sUYhSdipXG7rdXw19vkNdVdvYfd55qkhUkfytgfywuLcpnXBYyCzaIJVjyDgi82Fl5t4qd40gDjTXRYKYyEYK4CPT3UrOC3NIPr-ny2lmF2GUq2fH5yqmJ51WF9mkJKR0wePaWa\"></figure><p><br>Now coming to food, in the first few days I was surviving mostly on buying food and boiling <i>Maggi</i>. Soon my <i>Maggi</i> stock I carried from India diminished and I had to look elsewhere. There was a group of four girls from India who stayed together and knew how to cook. So, I was mostly found there for dinner every alternate day. Then somehow, I too developed the confidence to go grocery shopping and break eggs. By the end, I was cooking salmon fillets so I think I managed well and now know survival cooking. Although I could buy food everyday with my stipend but then that way, I wouldn’t have any cooking chronicles to tell and it wouldn’t have been as memorable. Prior to leaving I had memorized all the <i>Walmart</i> alleys and that is an achievement given how huge these superstores are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Difference in Research Environment in India</strong></p><blockquote><p>I picked a research internship over the on-campus corporate offer I had.</p></blockquote><p>I think the research environment abroad is a completely different prospect altogether majorly because funding isn't an issue at all, hence making it a very lucrative option without fretting much about the quick pay-off outlook. The kind of projects that students are working on, with access to <strong>state-of-art facilities,</strong> is unparalleled and in this sense most of the research institutions in India have a long way to go. I picked a research internship over the on-campus corporate offer I had, majorly because of the depth of project I was assigned to do here in Canada and the independence I had in choosing the workflow and deciding the proceedings.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I don't think any corporate internship could have given me the opportunity to interact and stay with probably the best minds of eleven different countries and not just working with them but to also learn about different cultures and ways of living.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Also the notion of research being a trying path is true in the sense of discipline people maintain towards the work but that doesn't interfere with the work life balance they have, which was true even for my internship as it had no fixed timings or days and mostly depended on my dedication towards the work.

The campus was filled with new stories of students getting placed every day with great brands. I was a bit tensed not being in the first few shortlists, but mostly sure that something is coming my way.</p><p>Finally, I got shortlisted by Morgan Stanley which was an on-campus offer. Despite the fact that it was an amazing company, I was not completely satisfied as I was looking for a product-based organisation instead of Fintech. So, I started applying for off-campus internship programs. At that time, one of my seniors posted about openings in Linkedin for interns. Within no time I forwarded him my resume. After getting shortlisted in the initial round, I was contacted by Linkedin HR for the Hackerrank test. After clearing the online test, I was called for 3 interviews consecutively. Fortunately, after cracking the interviews I finally received an email confirming my selection. Linkedin was kind enough to send some awesome goodies along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to May of this year, I got my joining date as 20th May for the internship. I was really hoping that my end semester exams would be over before that. To my surprise, I had two of my last exams scheduled on19th and a flight to catch the same night. It was one hell of a day. I landed in Bangalore at 4 am to realise something great was waiting for me there- the best thing about doing an internship at Linkedin is that you get to live in a 5-star hotel for the entire duration covering all your food, gym membership, laundry, pool and almost everything you can think of.<br><br><strong>The Office Experience</strong></p><p>The Linkedin office is one of the coolest places to work at. It is newly set up in Bangalore. The best part is that you get free food all around; you should not be surprised if you gain kilos before leaving this place. The place has its own cricket pitch, cafes, gym, nap room, music room and a lot more to offer. There are no timings as such and you can come and leave whenever you want, but try coming before 10 am or else you will miss your breakfast :P</p><p>As an intern, I got the chance to work with the Networking team at Linkedin. The networking team is responsible for designing and maintaining the backbone of the Linkedin network infrastructure and allowing seamless transfer of data between the Data Centres and Point of Presence(PoP’s) present at different geographical locations. My project was to detect silent packet drops taking place in the network and isolate the node causing the packet drop. I worked on some interesting networking technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS) and also got a chance to work with Golang. I have also written a separate blog explaining these technologies in detail.</p><p>I was fortunate to get this project as it exposed me to the world of computer networking beside the one we study in books. I realised that networking is not something you can study at your own like Android app development or Machine Learning. It requires infrastructure and high domain-specific knowledge. My mentor was kind enough to transfer all his knowledge to me.</p><p><strong>Trips and Visits</strong></p><p>Linkedin is also known as the most employee- centric company and goes by the motto “Work Hard Party Harder”. Apart from team outings every Friday night, we were also taken to Nandi hills as the offsite outing. Located on the outskirts of Bangalore, this spot is one of the most exhilarating places to visit in the city. The day was packed with many different outdoor activities such as rock climbing, zipline, etc. The evening ended with jam session and DJ.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/Karan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.jpg\"></figure><p>Linkedin also arranged the trip to Wonderla.

This year they had selected the NGO “Shanti Bhawan”, which took responsibility for providing education to underprivileged children. To raise awareness about the campaign, we organized a flash mob inside the Linkedin campus and made posters and stickers. We were able to raise funds of over 2 lakhs in a short period of time. It was one of the most satisfying experiences of the intern period.</p><p><strong>Linkedin’s Got Talent</strong></p><p>‘Linkedin’s Got Talent’ is another great initiative in which the employees at Linkedin are motivated to showcase their talent in front of the whole workplace.

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Tarun Dokania, who scored a 99th percentile in GMAT and now as a part of Floating GMAT assists aspirants into reaching their top scores.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Since you studied at ESADE, what is the inherent difference between the way we conducted business here in India and there in Spain?</strong></p><p>It’s a complicated question, it depends to a large extent on the countries you are dealing with. While abroad you find a lot of flexibility, most Indian universities lack this flexibility; only a few universities incorporate this, for example, the ISB’s business program is excellent. They have the right professors, the right case studies, which amounts to the whole package. Teachers in most IIM's comes with a set idea that he students to know this by the end of the lecture. They come in with a presentation and the answer is decided, which is good, and you get to learn a lot. But what happens in a good business schools is you go in and the teacher gives you the basis, 'here’s the question, tell me how you will solve it'. And now based on your perspective the teacher will change the answer so we don't have one set definition, we have 7 answers and they are coming from 7 people with different backgrounds. No one is completely correct, and they're all almost at the answer, but instead of it being told to them, they deduced it.</p><p><strong>You’ve worked in Finance both in India and abroad. What’s the difference in how people in India invest, how they conduct business and how they do it abroad?</strong></p><p>There’s an inherent insecurity involved in a first world country. That is balanced by the risk and the potential of growth. You can certainly make more returns here but there is a greater risk. If you talk about business as a whole, some companies fall into place where the approachability and flexibility versus the work done do not match.</p><p>There are countries with great flexibility but little work is done. And then there are companies where great work is done but there is little flexibility. The US is one of the countries that maintain a good balance of both. Spain lies on the former end of the spectrum, while India lies on the opposite end. If you look at Spain, there's a great deal of flexibility and you work only 5 hours a day, you have time for your siestas and everything. In India it is the polar opposite, you have to get your work done and you have to stay 9-5. The approachability of a manager in India is a lot less than what you’d find in say Spain or Japan. In the US there is a balance, you've got a lot of work that is done. But there is some flexibility. So Spain is one end of the spectrum, where so much flexibility has made them lethargic. India is in that part of the spectrum where rigidity has made them inefficient. Then you have countries like Germany where there is a balance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You wrote a book about how your GMAT experience was and how you cracked it. What drove you to write a book?</strong></p><p>It's certainly a lot easier than it was before. Right now you even have publishing houses that you can pay to get your book published. Self-publishing is also an option. But even then, these houses won't put their name on just any book, they have quality checks. So you have to have a good idea, something you want to share and people want to listen, like a business. One of the reasons I did this was the myth around the exam and business education that it's somehow incredibly difficult and needs too much work. We have an industry that is plagued, somewhere education and coaching lost track of education and went more towards profitability, that cannot work, right? Someone&nbsp;somewhere had to do something. You can't take people of the age group 22-25 and confuse them further. These coaching centres don't take the time to get to know you as a person and get to know your strengths and your weaknesses, for an exam like GMAT, without knowing which sector you're weak in or which part you need to work upon. That entire idea is what led me to open Floating GMAT and led me to write the book.</p><p><strong>People in India often believe that a career in business is very exhausting and you have to put in a lot of hours leaving very little time for much else. Is it true?</strong></p><p>Business is such a field wherein you have to work a lot, yes. Let me use an analogy here&nbsp; like my father used to say, \"Success is like a bucket, but you can only fill it with sweat.\" You can fill it over 10 years, or you can fill it in 6 months. It's up to you. The thing is people at your level are willing to do that much work. And everyone above you already has put in those hours. Since to a large extent the results are directly proportional to the efforts you put in, if you have ambition and are willing to work towards it, you've gotta put in the hours.</p><p><strong>There is a saying about MBA, to describe it in one line, 'you pay to learn common sense.' Anything you'd like to say to that?</strong></p><p>It is true. Business is at its core common sense. You need to have a good product, and you just need to sell it for more than what it costs. That's common sense. That being said, can you run a successful business without an MBA? Yes. But does a degree make it easier? Certainly. However at the end of the day as long as you have a good product and know how to sell it, you'll do just fine. Later on, you can even hire the MBAs to do the managing part for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Many people believe personality is a big part of a career in business, something exams cant help one develop, what do you have to say about that?</strong></p><p>Not really. Personality isn't something that's necessary. The crux of a successful business is having a good product and a good idea. You need to have something that people will be willing to spend their money on. A good personality sure helps, but it's not something that is absolutely important. You shouldn't go buy a suit just because you are entering business school. The most important aspect is getting a good idea and thinking about how you can sell it efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Most people pursuing an MBA opt for either finance or marketing, hence there is a large supply of people specialized in these fields. Are there other subjects also which are underrated but have a massive scope?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, one such up and coming field is Data Science: Data Analysts are used in almost every big company. In the field of business, business psychology is also a course with a lot of potential. It might take about 5-10 years to establish in India, this degree is very valuable in countries like Europe. Although, nothing is going to beat finance or marketing, since they are the pillars of business and that is what business is all about<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>by Anushka Sharma, MAM, 3rd Year and Mihir Ranjan, EE, 2nd Year</strong></i></p><p>On the 22nd of July, 2019, India buckled up to make history as the first country to successfully attempt a soft landing on the moon in their first attempt with their latest lunar probe, the Chandrayaan-2. Vikram lander, named after the father of India’s space programme Vikram Sarabhai, was scheduled to soft-land on the lunar surface, past midnight on the 6th of August, 2019. However, in the starry mornings of the 7th of September, as Chandrayaan-2 attempted to land on the moon, the lander lost communication when touchdown communication was expected, with it deviating from its trajectory at 2.1 km from the surface of the moon.</p><p>That does not imply however that the mission was a disaster, in fact it was quite the contrary. Chandrayaan - 2 still got a lunar orbiter in place, with 8 of its 13 payloads working. ISRO managed to slow down the landers speed from 21,600 km/h to a mere 7 km/h, nearly perfecting the technology.</p><p>It’s not the final 2.1 kilometres that mattered, it's the 3.84 lakhs that came before it.</p><p>It seemed almost as if a silence spread across the entire nation, with us being mere minutes away from having our names etched in immortality. As the officials waited with bated breath for the glitch to be resolved, it seemed an all too anticlimactic end for a journey this pragmatic.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, social media is being flooded with messages expressing utmost respect and admiration for the ISRO Team. In our time of need, the nation united as one to prove that we did not fail, we set an example. The people never stopped believing for a single second. And given how far we came, we know we have the mettle to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>One should not fear the dark in the night, for the stars always shine true above you.</p><p>There’s no prouder day to be an Indian, for not only did we in the true Indian spirit, heavily optimize this mission and reduce its cost, but we also managed to complete 90% of the mission objectives. The fact that families were up in the night to potentially witness history shows the belief we have in our scientists.&nbsp;</p><p>However, not all hope is lost.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-cheers-to-gloom-what-transpired-inside-mission-centre/story-u5gdxoBwX1UaGWxxIIscvO.html\">Indian Space Research Organisation</a>, is making all <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-vikram-lander-isn-t-getting-signals-chandrayaan-1-director-has-a-theory/story-OohTW58ExvorZg2FcTlkWO.html\">possible efforts to establish communication </a>with Vikram lander that has been<a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-s-vikram-lander-lying-tilted-on-moon-but-in-one-piece/story-te7esihMhCv1BmeVfYWv7H.html\"> lying on the moon for three days now</a>, it has been located, lying in a tilted position close to its landing spot in the lunar south pole region.

Let this only instil our hearts with zeal and fervor, for we Indians do not go gently, into that good night.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Sanjay Kumar, India Country Director, Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University, who was in DTU for a talk session organised by Let's Talk.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How is living in India and how has the culture you were brought up in shaped your ideologies today?</strong></p><p>I think more than culture the practice which I did helped me. The more practice I did on the ground, the more I became who I am today. Like I mentioned, when students are young in their undergrad and they go to the market for jobs or to become an entrepreneur, they get to see how the real world is. I worked with&nbsp;<i>Seva,</i>&nbsp;which is based on Gandhian philosophy, and that is why a lot of my ideas and beliefs came out of my practice and participation there.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that the number of PhD applicants from India is decreasing year by year. Why do you think this pattern is emerging?</strong></p><p>I think one possible reason could be that they are applying to other countries. Maybe the other reason could be that these students feel that there is no scholarship available so they don't understand the real situation. They think that there is not enough funding for students but it's wrong, we encourage students to apply because&nbsp;it's a completely funded program<i>.</i> Somehow I think the other possible reason could be that those who are coming back to the country after doing MBA and engineering, they think that it can be more rewarding in terms of money as compared to doing a PhD. They believe that getting into research is not financially viable.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that India's youth needs to be encouraged to pursue science whereas India has the largest army of engineers all over the world. Why do you think that teenagers today are not as interested in science?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Engineering is more job-oriented but science is more research-oriented.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>What we promote is the general interest in science which is not increasing somehow, so the reason we are organising these events around science is to get the fear of science out of people at a younger age. There's a fear that science is intimidating. There is no culture of research in the country as of now and I wish that it would change.</p><p><strong>Can a reason behind fewer scientists in India be that the Government of India does not give enough financial incentives for research?</strong></p><p>I think that we need to change that since it's a major issue, and other western countries invest a lot in their research. Even China is investing a lot in science and building institutions because they have understood that science is the future and it can solve all of their problems. We see science only in science but they see science in everything. There needs to be more coordination between industry, academia and government. So these are the things where we are trying to work with some of the government agencies and companies.</p><p><strong>Indian institutes charge nominal fees from the students as opposed to higher fees charged by foreign institutes. Can this be attributed as one of the reasons why we receive less funding?</strong></p><p>I think Indian institutions receive good grants but somehow scientific institutions need to improve their administration and they will have to be innovative in terms of collaboration with industries and other institutions. For example, there is a system in Ivy League universities that if you don't find a book in a particular library, you can request for the book and if it's available in another library of some other universities, the book can be provided to you. So, in terms of that, we can also collaborate and we can also start initiatives like this and I think educational advancement is not a priority in our institutions. They should focus on the quality of education for students and teaching rather getting into things which are not so important. The students are doing fantastic I must say. They run clubs and societies and learn so much leadership through various activities. So similarly, teaching can be improved and the quality can be improved and exposure can be increased it all depends on the administration of the college.</p><p><strong>What is the one thing you love about our education system and one thing you love about theirs?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Our system is very reasonably priced and easily accessible, unlike other countries which charge a lot and are out of reach for a lot of students.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>They see education as an investment which we don't see as of now. We don't have many visionary leaders who can think beyond their times as to how they will change the face of the country. We are missing a lot and I found a lot of people there who think beyond their tenure and that's how they have made these massive institutes there. To think beyond oneself and for the greater good of the institution is a practice our administration needs to take up.</p><p><strong>A growing number of countries are coming to very unconventional methods of education. Is there a problem with standardized testing that needs to be re-evaluated?</strong></p><p>I think standardized testing does not bring out the best in every child because every student is not standardised. Merit cannot be standardised but in a populated country like India, I don't see how we can test merits. The way foreign countries engage in education with children is more about opening up and making the best out of their inherent talent and the inbuilt talent of the student so the education system works as a facilitator than determining who you are, what you do and things like that. So I think India can learn from different countries in how to get rid of rote learning and how we can teach students to learn beyond exams and learn beyond books.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has the experience of publishing a book been so far?</strong></p><p>I wanted to capture my journey and how I dealt with failure. I wanted to organise all these messages from my life in a book. It has been a good journey so far. I get to see a lot of people and youngsters and learn a lot from them so I think there is mutual learning which is happening. As an author, meeting a lot of people and getting to know what they think of me, what I'm doing and how the book is, is a great experience. This has also ended up in making a community and bringing a lot of people closer and be a part of my volunteering campaign. My organisation currently works at rejuvenating the public schools and state-run educational institutions and some of the students in DTU have been part of the campaign which is helping them learn leadership abilities. This has happened because of the book and I am very happy that I could do this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you manage the time between working at your job and for your social cause? What message do you have for people who also want to pursue several different things at once as you did?</strong></p><p>I think you always find time for the things that you are passionate about. You need to prioritise and need to find time during the weekend, after office hours etc. I think that you have to compromise on your time of enjoyment and your time of togetherness with friends and families and if you are chasing your passion and a bigger cause, you will have to find the time to run your career and your passion while making time for your friends and family. You do have to make compromises but I am sure that people who care for you and the nation at large, they understand what you are doing and why you are not available to your friends and your family.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviews Aditya Arora, the CEO of Faad Networks who recently graduated and was present as a mentor for the E-Cell Startup Weekend.</strong></i></p><p><strong>You’re the CEO of Faad Networks, why is something like Faad needed in the industries of today?</strong></p><p>When you hear about startups, startups raise million dollar IPOs, but before they raise this amount there's this early seed fund that it needs in order to grow and to sustain in the early stages, something like 25-50 lacs and although its a small amount compared to a million dollars, sometimes it proves to be the deciding factor in the survival of the startup. Thats how Faad started, we are solving the pinpoints of early-stage startups by raising capitals from the investors because that's the hardest to raise, but once you have done that the path becomes a bit easier. We are helping them not just with capital but also to grow, because what will we do with the capital, capital gets no returns when the company doesn't grow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You’re a startup that helps other startups by giving them money, wasn’t it challenging building a company around this and get the investors and the necessary funds?</strong></p><p>There were lots of challenges, for one it was a 20 year-old boy pitching to investors asking for money, I don't come from a background of investing or startups, my partners also, one is an engineer and the other an Ayurveda doctor. No one in this company comes from a typical VC background hence raising money was hard.&nbsp;</p><p>Locking these investors and their capitals with us was also a big challenge, because there are so many enterprises out there and as we say, money will be put wherever they sniff the best returns. We have to lock in that capital with us, so whenever that startup comes to us for funding we can always supply them with funds, it shouldn’t be a supply demand problem.</p><p><strong>Money is invested where they see the most returns, so what do you look for in startups that make you want to invest in them?</strong></p><p>We have the 5 Ts of investing.</p><p>1. Team - The biggest factor, because business models, everything can be altered but the people themselves cant be altered. If the team has passion and dedication then its the key to success for the firm.</p><p>2. Technology - What level of tech are they using in order to help them scale up to the next level of the market and increase their operations.</p><p>3. Traction - Basically metrics of the startups reach and activity. What sort of revenue the company is clocking or if its an app how many daily, monthly active users, customer retention, average time on the app etc.</p><p>4. Ten x Potential - If you are a startup and you have a value of 5 crores today, I want you to become a 50 crores entity, since that is wherein the profit lies for me. So do you have that potential, can you crack the market and 10x from the baseline. X to 10 X as we say in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Terms - What are the terms of investment, what is the equity you are offering me, the payout of the equity, what's in it for me basically because that’s a very important factor for investors. Lots of options are there, debt funding, pure equity, convertible equity etc. What keeps me interested, what's the skin in the game for me etc.</p><p><strong>What are some of the core factors where entrepreneurs have the potential to “crack the market” and establish themselves?</strong></p><p>Investments themselves by virtue of the concept is an ever booming market, startups right now also require funds and 30 years later will also require funds to grow. But we are seeing almost replicas of startups that are already out there in the market, we are seeing someone is trying to create the next Amazon, someone the next Google, so innovation in itself is not at the pace it could be happening in India, as compared to other countries, even our neighbouring ones, that is one of the biggest challenges to our industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing is the validation, people are looking to raise X amounts of capital and not justifying it, either the business is too frugal or its too early to raise that capital, or they should wait for some time and try to grow the business from bootstrap and not risk capital on that. On the government's side as well there is still a lot of clout over taxation issues, there is an angel tax which has to be properly addressed, hence a lot of issues remain.</p><p>Overall, our economy is in a recessionary phase as our consumption has slowed down, so we don’t know how the next set of consumers from India will come and approach this. But overall, money is there in the market. People are sitting on huge piles of cash, but where to put in the money and why is how we at Faad try to help.</p><p><strong>We have an incubation facility in DTU which also aims at the same thing, you talked about government policies also, are there any ways the government can assist entrepreneurs from both the college and outside?</strong></p><p>DTU in itself is one of the five colleges that has been funded 100% by the Delhi State Govt. Taking into account the technological prowess the college has since an incubation centre is known from its students who’s ideas it incubates. It’s not known as the DTU IIF but by the people who work here and who make DTU the college that it is. In terms of scouting, there needs to be a lot of help, there is a huge scope for more collaborations since this phase in any startup is about collaboration, not competition. At the end of the day you, me and the incubation centre have the same purpose. We all want to see your startup grow. Either we do it in our own individual ways, or if we can do it better together, let’s join hands and make it happen. The government should step up not just as a liaison for startups and incubation centres, but also work not just as a mediator, as a third entity where they can help these startups and connect them with the right investors since each investor has their own mindset. Additionally, they should look at the profiling of these startups at the grassroots level and sit down to get what the investors’ doubts and issues are and help resolve them. Obviously the most important thing is what happens after the incubation. During the incubation you are in a protected environment, you have the resources and the knowledge with you. But once you step out its the outside world and its a dirty dirty world as we say. So stepping out, what can incubation cells give as a post-incubation process and how can this communication be managed, all can be improved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A lot of the students here do not have much experience in the fields of business, so what is some advice you could give them to help them also take their ideas further?</strong></p><p>I decided to intern at a company called Faad which I’m now the CEO of, but my journey wasn’t easy, I went through it the hard way. My office was based in Saket and I lived in Rohini with a college in East Delhi, alongside that I had to manage my social campaign as well called Education Yatra for which I’m a Microsoft Chain Maker under the age of 20. The point is that you have to take a leap of faith by trusting your instincts and the kind of work you are doing, as a youth I believe why people don’t get returns because they are highly erratic and they are very impatient. They expect quick returns in short periods of time. I stuck with Faad throughout, there was one single room in which we were where we used to do everything. I stuck with them because I saw the vision of what Faad could be. Seeing the vision for not only the company but yourself and whether your wishes aligned with them or not is one very important factor you need to have. You need to know the Y of your life, even my TedX talk revolves around this only, in mathematics you always have to find the value of x, but if you know the value of Y, trust me you can find the value of X.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>DTU Times interviewed Sunil Solanki, Sr. Director, Country Head, SAP, who attended the Startup Weekend as one of the judges.</p><p><strong>There are multiple technologies that have a lot of potential in today's market. Being technical students, what are some technologies that we can tap into?</strong></p><p>If I am talking about the list of technologies, the list is endless. It could include anything from Cloud Computing to IoT to AI to RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to something you might not have even heard about. The idea is to figure out which technology to choose, since in today's date the students are very confused and whichever course that a senior follows everyone seems to be following the same path. A few years ago it was Cloud and now it is AI. One should do study the top companies in the field of technology and the product which they focus on currently, will tell you what is in demand. If you go and see the blogs of Microsoft or SAP, SAP isn't talking about its ARP, it is talking about its RPA, Robotic Process Automation.</p><p>There are some technologies which have not yet matured and there are more advanced technologies coming and hitting us, one has to be prepared to capture these technologies.</p><p>Nowadays, if the CEO of a company wants to get immediate data, say the production of one of his plants, he has to wait minimum 4-5 hours while 15-20 individuals all pass the information down the chain of command, whereas with automation, using a few chat bots and data analysis programs, he can simply ask and like Siri and Alexa get the information in a few seconds. This is the practical reality and what is required, identifying areas which are running the entire supply chain today.</p><p><strong>Nowadays mass recruiting is a common practice among Engineering Colleges, many students prefer to stay in the comfort zone and do not wish to go into these up and coming technologies, due to the risk factor. How can we create an environment for innovation bolstering students to go into these new fields?</strong></p><p>This environment comes from the surrounding support ecosystem. Taking the example of DTU, it is my first visit here, I feel like you have everything. You have industry experts coming and guiding you and you are going to industries. The DTU management and administration is so flexible, I have never heard of an institute that is helping in patenting, research and incubation. These are the important aspects, that make it a highly open environment.</p><p><strong>What are some of the key factors we look for in a successful startup?</strong></p><p>Most people will tell you many criterion for a successful startup. In my opinion, for a country like India, we as a people are very efficient as we have our strengths and our weaknesses. Considering this, your startup should focus on a couple of things. Firstly, your startup should be impacting a lot of people in the beginning itself, even if it is B2B. Secondly, wherever possible, get a big supporter. We always think to cut down on the cost by using open source or other such technologies, however in the beginning, your priority is to keep your business running, and if you can get a big supporter to give you a push by using their products exclusively inside your business such that even they have an incentive to support you, you will go a long way. Since you are creating this idea from scratch and are involved with the entire working of the model, and you are also involved in marketing, and finance etc.. getting a big supporter will be of great assistance to you. So always take help from the ecosystem. Lastly, grey hair has to be respected, and that can come as expertise working for you, as a mentor, as a guide, as a professor or even as an industry expert, and that is something you have to respect because that insight is something you can never get without experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Many students here do not have proper experience in the fields of business, they do not know marketing or finance and how to create proper working business models. How can engineering students increase their exposure to the business side of things to ease the process of entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>Before being engineering students, you are primarily students. Don't tag yourself right now. The world you have seen in these 18-20 years are enough to create the entire story. In today's world, a samosa seller does not need an expertise in business or samosas, he can figure that out. That basic test has to be done by you, because you aren't that ignorant, and you know a lot. In an institute like DTU, you also have MBA links and you can always engage them at the right stage for expertise. Never hesitate, never think you don't have the capability of doing something. Just for fine tuning or for presenting it to a bigger firm or to a venture capitalist, you can hire a small agency or a PR firm, and you can take your colleagues and your friends who are learning these skills. There are two things, one is Go Do's and the other is Show Do's. So first focus on the Go Do's and then worry about the Show Do's.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any message you have for the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>The message is simply that you have got everything. Great education that has got you here, and great exposure from people both internal and external to help you. Even the sky is not the limit for you. This branch tag also dissuades people from exploring options outside their stream. Someone in Mechanical or Automation would think he would get only Hyundai or Tata Motors. Can you not go in the IoT wing or the supply chain management wing of these big companies? So remove this stigma of branch from your mind. Engineering is a graduation in and of itself. It is a bit high tech, and makes you use your mind more. Never, never, never be limited by your branch.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>2 years ago, you tweeted “Why is it that the young minds are being misinformed?” Can you expand on this statement and its relevance in today’s environment?</strong></p><p>In the last few years, fake news has become a global epidemic. Most of the fake news spreads through digital media, and because of its wide consumption, people tend to believe most of it. It's problematic because youngsters are quite malleable. They are very smart, but they fall prey to fake news because they have no means to confirm the news. That’s the reason why I started NewsMobile 5 years ago. The goal was to give people news which is fact checked and credible every time, so that youngsters don’t have to suffer and form opinions based on inaccurate reporting.</p><p><strong>The last decade has seen journalists face grave consequences for their crusades in reporting. What are some shortcomings that you, as a journalist, feel in a country as culturally sensitive as India?</strong></p><p>While you have to tell stories as they are, you have to keep a few things in mind. I have done my journalism without any fear or bias; I led the campaign against a food scam that led to the resignation of India’s then foreign minister. I’ve even done the Dawood tapes against the biggest criminal of that time. So as far as the story is verified and correct, you should not be shying away from the essence of the story. However, there are times when I have decided not to do a certain story because it impinges on national interest, and that is where your role as a responsible journalist comes in. That is where you should always strike that balance; national interest is always paramount.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A growing number of journalists are known to be affiliated with certain political parties. How does this affect the authenticity of reporting?</strong></p><p>I believe that journalists should not be affiliated to any political party. We at NewsMobile have our employees sign an undertaking confirming that they are not a member of any political party, and a lot of other companies do so. You, of course, may have your bias. For example, I write extensively on foreign policy; I support certain initiatives that the PM has taken, but I am also critical about him if there’s a lynching happening. Therefore, I think that at his core, a journalist has to be objective. What every organisation has to do is make them sign an undertaking saying that they are not affiliated with any political party whatsoever, be careful about its integrity and make sure biased journalism is reduced.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>As readers, we’re unaware about any affiliations that a reporter might have. Do you have any tips on spotting biased journalism?</strong></p><p>Today’s readers are very smart, and they can easily make out if something's biased or not. I constantly tell my young journalists that their readers are the smartest of the lot and they should never even <i>try</i> to fool or outsmart them. However, as a reader, you have to be more aware and participative in order to develop an eye and recognize patterns for what seems legitimate and what doesn’t. It’s a two-way street; if biased journalism starts to get called out more often, it will decrease.</p>",

Previously, I had been a part of the Google Summer of Code program for two years in a row, taking turns both as a student and as a mentor. Consequently, I thought the interview situation would be something as depicted by the meme below-</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cJd9JdecgK_B_Yw2nTd3qWwlNVDd9AucW4OKx8jDeBHmqQ8vgXBGYZ68xQU3UMtLvzmi-OIttvLKBD4zM0XxGNsFPltynzJ8fSuUZwNyQGA_-biQHGMvUrU5KIRx77fsPgmYki9X\"></figure><p>Little did I know that getting a Software Internship while being in a non-software branch was not an easy task, and no one actually cared about GSoC. After randomly scrolling through the Resume Manager for a few days, I realized that getting an on-campus internship might never get crossed off the bucket list.</p><p>A few good companies did allow my branch but I never made it to the interviews. I contacted a few of my seniors and then started my voyage for an off-campus internship. I got an offer from Hackerrank after sometime and this remained the only offer I had until a week from the end semester exams of the 6th semester. Somehow, I managed to get a referral at Amazon and after clearing the test, I had only one online interview remaining which lasted for about 1.5 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>I got the offer but screwed up my end-sems. The trade-off was worth it though. The decision between Hackerrank and Amazon was tough but I decided to go with Amazon as it better aligned with my interests at the time.</p><h3><strong>Getting there (and back :P)</strong></h3><p>Amazon will take care of everything from flights to accommodation for you. I had my joining on 3rd June and I was given residence at the 5-star Oakwood Residence Kapil Hyderabad (only for 2 weeks though :/). Amazon also provides free of cost cabs from hotel to office for interns for the entire duration of their internship.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cuKje37VwJYyFgi-uc-t7RZ_yFzomBF2vg7Snq0gpHR8F7quf56K9byMy2Rnyp52QSqLt1s_uSW3W6hefWjRJGPWDJwIGLPddbsHEVFGxlk7ZkEmvNoDVBF2P58cL3DvtGuAY-YP\"></figure><p>The first day is New Hire Orientation and this session was a lot of fun. All the new hires ranging from interns to managers attend this session, which was quite interactive. They introduce you to the culture of Amazon, 14 leadership principles followed at Amazon, a few fun stories from the early days, after which the interns are given their gear (Laptop, T-shirt, a bag and a few more things). There is also a photo-shoot for the ID card, which is given the next day along with some auto-generated alias. The alias assigned to me was ‘madrathi’, which was pretty badass.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1j8QFoRfysgf425mZiXR39A0ns_RL-xX9QhyvkKGJi85r0RzKpyBVivgjIQ9Twv_24JHV85sm0L3ZArLpXDKBqg9CTxXJGvsCreSta2hqA3QpCbng5aUzBnBc4m6W-ZtYYSAXfIp\"></figure><p>Following this session, I met my team. Amazon pairs every intern with a mentor for the entire duration of the intern. The first week was spent in setting up my workstation. At the end of the first week, every SDE new hire attends an SDE boot camp. This is where they introduce you to the state-of-the-art technologies that Amazon uses internally.</p><p>From the second week onward, the interns are briefed about their projects, and are expected to start learning all the involved technologies through internal Wiki resources. My project had a few dependencies which got delayed and following this, my manager decided to change my team so that I can start working on a new project. This however required me to shift to Delhi office as the new team was based in Delhi. I left for Delhi at the end of my second week and couldn’t explore Hyderabad at all but it was good while it lasted.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WY4byJ2TRwe0eiRcKrVNmWnzfsL-JM_7dq6lM9bFeyfBXD5Raoawb3wuyOsHmN9ljG3OysIf4FWqBy7kpdXfUR0M1mxbUVoPs7K8MWdw9NMMZyZDaxfUm_Gv9YsIJQJVhSJVfIjP\"></figure><p>The Delhi office was located in Ambience Corporate Towers, just behind Ambience Mall, Gurgaon.</p><h3><strong>Work</strong></h3><p>Amazon doesn’t differentiate between interns and full-time employees, so don’t expect any hand-holding whatsoever. This does not mean that doubts are not entertained. Interns are required to propose multiple solutions for a given problem statement, which will be discussed in a design review. The design review meetings often involve senior SDEs too. My mentor prepared me well for this review meeting, where all of the possible approaches are discussed, and the best one is picked after weighing the trade-offs. My project involved highly confidential data and some serious security measures were discussed in the meetings to handle the same. My final design was closed after three iterations of design review. My project was confidential as the features are yet to be announced officially so I won’t be explaining the details here. The team was highly supportive and I could always share my ideas as it would always lead to an informative discussion. Once, I remember that I was designing a database schema and I got great tips on designing a composite primary key, and on manipulating pagination in DynamoDB for supporting my query from a senior SDE who wasn’t even part of my team! (was a member of a sister team). People here are extremely smart and very approachable. They are super fun and very closely knit, and I had the most amazing manager. He was very approachable and understanding. Amazon has everything built internally so you are provided with an internal Google, internal StackOverflow and an internal Wikipedia (all with different names though), and they are enough to answer any query one might have. One thing I liked about Amazon is that employees are given complete ownership of their projects. They can name it however they like; they can use whatever technology they like as long as it helps in improving the overall architecture, and you're able to get it approved in the design reviews. My team had projects named after Death Note characters like Light Document Extractor, Rem Document Uploader, Ryuk Document Querier, etc. I completed my project before the deadline and also volunteered for a side project which would be helpful for all the new hires in Amazon. So, if you're planning to join Amazon, do check out OpsConfigReplicator on their Wiki search.</p><h3><strong>Lifestyle</strong></h3><p>Amazon has no office timings. Check-in and check-out whenever you want. Being physically present in the office isn’t even a necessity. If you can deliver from home, well, work from home then. For food, Amazon provides meal coupons worth Rs.1100 every month. The cafeteria serves good food with a bunch of options on the menu.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KfFtvmlrZXWQ_dbp92mIwk4YEyuq1WXihiT60iBa-HMyXlUIY4ODdvx7SGZLMfy0wlf5_NnSAe1y5ZapwbKiwyP14wClJvMtaUtTqhhjR9IDFD1FeTg3LbP3lIV2rTqq9naRtpaQ\"></figure><p>Amazon's office had a great play area having games like Foosball, Pool, Table Tennis, Xbox, etc. My teammates were so hooked on these games that they once resolved the dispute of seating arrangement at our new location by drawing fixtures of foosball match.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-awv9rhjNKqDSM_4IsMKNzz50XvRtVkjR48_84RVpW2XZtTXHT6lR1Ns4x3CtnO6mpa43YjDv7Tykl4JCIaobljywlFuxbbC1WAYoxHzcX7r9t8zZoFWEc2LrEmEaFgr4J57x1qZ\"></figure><p>My team went out to celebrate every little moment. I remember when India got knocked out of the World Cup, my manager took the team to Canvas Laugh Club to lighten the mood. The show somehow had way too many jokes on interns so it didn't help much in fixing my mood :P</p><h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3><p>One major takeaway for me was to think and discuss before implementing. Coming from college we usually value code more than the meetings and discussions, but while working for a corporation that has a huge user database, you have to be careful about everything. Prior discussion and meetings can align you better with the final goal and avoid pitfalls. I also gained more confidence while picking up new technologies and delivering the project within the deadline.</p><p>This internship was one of the most memorable time for me and it was way better than my average college life. I was a bit disheartened when it got over but Tony Stark said it right, “<i>Part of the journey is the end</i>”. Below is the workstation I left on the 2nd of August-</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1Dx0KPdegAQNa3JaloywJsUOjWHQJD4kT_zx2Jx8vDzpeYQiruROlxVfKeTQSkfWnbn55WDWL35zRv8ashQXhrodHB9Orv3nN_8Qv1vdbaztuDyKgSTeKxC_r5G9fBsrtDPmlLRU\"></figure><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>I would advise everyone reading this to stay motivated throughout the placement and internship season. This time can get depressing if you don't get what you want so please reach out to anyone who you are comfortable with, if you are feeling low. I had 2 internship offers and countless rejections, but in the end, I only remember the selections. You just have to make it once, so no matter where you are, never give up and keep fighting. Also, please be in touch with your seniors.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>At times, we tend to ignore opportunities that could benefit us. I had a great set of seniors who guided me and kept me motivated throughout the intern season. So never be afraid to reach out.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I hope you all have a great experience in bagging those offers. Break a leg!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The cafeteria serves good food with a bunch of options on the menu.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KfFtvmlrZXWQ_dbp92mIwk4YEyuq1WXihiT60iBa-HMyXlUIY4ODdvx7SGZLMfy0wlf5_NnSAe1y5ZapwbKiwyP14wClJvMtaUtTqhhjR9IDFD1FeTg3LbP3lIV2rTqq9naRtpaQ\"></figure><p>Amazon's office had a great play area having games like Foosball, Pool, Table Tennis, Xbox, etc. My teammates were so hooked on these games that they once resolved the dispute of seating arrangement at our new location by drawing fixtures of Foosball match.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-awv9rhjNKqDSM_4IsMKNzz50XvRtVkjR48_84RVpW2XZtTXHT6lR1Ns4x3CtnO6mpa43YjDv7Tykl4JCIaobljywlFuxbbC1WAYoxHzcX7r9t8zZoFWEc2LrEmEaFgr4J57x1qZ\"></figure><p>My team went out to celebrate every little moment. I remember when India got knocked out of the World Cup, my manager took the team to <i>Canvas Laugh Club</i> to lighten the mood. The show somehow had way too many jokes on interns so it didn't help much in fixing my mood :P</p><h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3><p>One major takeaway for me was to <strong>think and discuss before implementing.</strong> Coming from college we usually value code more than the meetings and discussions, but while working for a corporation that has a huge user database, you have to be careful about everything. Prior discussion and meetings can align you better with the final goal and avoid pitfalls. I also gained more confidence while picking up new technologies and delivering the project within the deadline.</p><p>This internship was one of the most memorable time for me and it was way better than my average college life. I was a bit disheartened when it got over but Tony Stark said it right, “<i>Part of the journey is the end</i>”. Below is the workstation I left on the 2nd of August-</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1Dx0KPdegAQNa3JaloywJsUOjWHQJD4kT_zx2Jx8vDzpeYQiruROlxVfKeTQSkfWnbn55WDWL35zRv8ashQXhrodHB9Orv3nN_8Qv1vdbaztuDyKgSTeKxC_r5G9fBsrtDPmlLRU\"></figure><h3><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>I would advise everyone reading this to <strong>stay motivated throughout the placement and internship season</strong>. This time can get depressing if you don't get what you want so please reach out to anyone who you are comfortable with, if you are feeling low.<strong> I had 2 internship offers and countless rejections, </strong>but in the end, I only remember the selections. You just have to make it once, so no matter where you are, never give up and keep fighting. Also, please be in touch with your seniors.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>At times, we tend to ignore opportunities that could benefit us. I had a great set of seniors who guided me and kept me motivated throughout the intern season. So never be afraid to reach out.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I hope you all have a great experience in bagging those offers. Break a leg!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>-Vishesh Kashyap, Editor-in-Chief</strong></p><p>What makes one an engineer? Is it the degree or the vocation? Is a business analyst with an engineering degree still an engineer?</p><p>That a large number of engineering students immediately move on to jobs not remotely associated with the field – much less practice – of engineering is a fact well known to most related to the area of engineering education. Any comparison between the number of students graduating with an engineering degree every year and that doing so with a heightened disenchantment with the very discipline they are now professionally certified for is likely to astound a neutral observer no end.</p><blockquote><p>...less than 7% of engineering graduates were employable in the disciplines they had earned their degrees</p></blockquote><p>India’s engineering boom began post liberalisation, spearheaded by a considerable influx of IT and software jobs and followed closely by a growing focus on infrastructure development. By the new millennium, engineering had become something of a default degree – a slingshot into sectors across the job spectrum. By 2013-14, <a href=\"https://thewire.in/education/indias-engineering-education-story-with-an-eye-on-tamil-nadus-colleges\">1 in 6</a> Indian undergraduates were enrolled in engineering institutes, the number of such institutes growing from around 400 in 1990 to more than 3400 in 2018.</p><p>An Aspiring Minds <a href=\"https://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%20Annual%20Report%202016.pdf\">study</a> in 2016 claimed that less than 7% of engineering graduates were employable in the disciplines they had earned their degrees. In a 2013 survey, it was found that <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-the-engineering-dream-over-after-iit-students-now-prefer-mba-and-govt-jobs/story-skQp6FdebWG7o1qSnnDUKO.html\">78%</a> IIT Bombay graduates took up jobs in sectors not related to engineering and technology. Logic follows that an engineering degree stands as no more than an avenue to a job – any job – as it acts for employers across industries as a sign of the empirical competence (not necessarily related to engineering or technical competence) of the candidate. Hence the relative rush of non-engineering firms looking for engineering graduates, and vice-versa.</p><blockquote><p>While prestigious engineering institutes continue to report good results, the number of graduates actively opting for a career in engineering continues to fall.</p></blockquote><p>However, with the increase in such jobs not necessarily keeping up with the rapid increase in graduates – and India not becoming a core engineering powerhouse anyway – the appeal of an engineering degree has begun to fall. <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/education/80-engineering-seats-in-odisha-went-vacant-this-year-5956395/\">80%</a> of engineering seats in Odisha, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/60-of-engineering-seats-remain-vacant/article28985408.ece\">60%</a> in Karnataka, <a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/engineering-colleges-enrolment-going-down/828919.html\">52%</a> in Haryana and <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/70-mechanical-and-civil-engineering-seats-vacant-in-maharashtra-colleges/articleshow/70824450.cms\">49%</a> in Maharashtra remained vacant this year. While prestigious engineering institutes continue to report good results, the number of graduates actively opting for a career in engineering continues to fall.</p><p>The question remains – are our engineering institutes producing engineers anymore? The lines between being an engineer and not continue to be increasingly blurred.</p>",

The transplantation drive is being carried out to clear out three different sites for the construction of two new academic blocks, a boy's hostel, and a girl's hostel, at the campus. The trees are being transplanted along the road towards the sports complex. Nearly 80 trees have been transplanted and another 30 are in the process of being moved within DTU.</p><blockquote><p>“Rather than cutting them, we decided to go with transplantation. We believe the project will accomplish an 85% survival rate. The work has been going on for around 20 days now, and it has already been carried out for some 80 trees, all of which are healthy, We are also planting additional 1,100 trees on the campus to compensate for the movement.\" - Professor Yogesh Singh, Vice Chancellor, DTU&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>“Today, we have witnessed how a tree can be transplanted successfully and that there’s no need to cut a tree, no matter how large it is. This is very encouraging for us and for the environment. Through a new policy, we have mandated that if any new construction is to take place within Delhi, 80% of the trees being felled for a project will have to be transplanted instead,” said Hon'ble Chief Minister, who was at the campus, along with the Deputy Chief Minister, to witness the process of transplantation. He also watered a tree which was over 15 years old.</p>",

    "body": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Sidharth Bansal, Software Engineering, Class of 2020, shares his experience of interning at Google Office, Hyderabad through an on-campus opportunity.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I joined Delhi Technological University, I didn't know much about Multinational&nbsp;<br>Corporations and was aware ​of only a few companies. I also did not research much about companies other than the premier ones like Google, Microsoft and Amazon. These were hence my only priorities. Although, I was afraid initially because in the year of 2016, Google didn’t visit DTU. Most of the MNCs require production-level projects and this made me want to invest my time and efforts in such projects.&nbsp;<br>In order to fulfil my aim of getting into Google, I targeted the <strong>Google Summer of Code.</strong> My GSoC mentor, Mr. Jeffrey Warren, was highly impressed with my GSoC project and my administrative work at <strong>Google Code-In</strong>. He granted me some freelancing contracts at Public Lab. I became a mentor at <strong>Google Code-in</strong>, <strong>Outreachy</strong> and <strong>Google Summer Of Code</strong>. I also prepared rigorously for the technical interviews and fortunately got internship on-campus offers from <i><strong>Amazon</strong></i> and&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Google</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>I joined Google India (Hyderabad Office) on 20 May 2019. I had to join the team just the day after my last theory exam of the sixth semester. Hence, I had to rush to the Airport directly from the examination hall. But it was all worth it, I was heading to my dream place after all.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Food&nbsp;</strong><br>Everyone is curious about the food culture at Google. To my surprise, there were a wide variety of food items that could be made available whenever we wanted it. Google’s Hyderabad office has three cafeterias with a Sandwich Corner and Pop-up Snacks Corner. We had a food truck for exotic Chinese food.&nbsp;<br>We even had a micro-kitchen with two-three refrigerators at each floor full of coke, juices, cheese and much more. You could take chocolates and even protein bars (for health-conscious people) to your desk and code while you eat. Cafeteria included a live kitchen too. And, all of it was for free!<br><br><strong>TGIF&nbsp;</strong><br>Google has a culture of celebrating Fridays. <strong>TGIF </strong>stands for ‘Thank God! It's Friday!’. We all become completely exhausted after working for five continuous days at the office and the solution to the tiredness was TGIF! If you ever think the above range of appetizers and snacks on weekdays is less alluring then you could always join 'TGIF'. TGIF holds weekly meetings where leaders and directors give motivational speeches. You can enjoy listening to them with fluffy cotton candies and piquant snacks. ‘Googlers’ love food! And, TGIF and snacks go hand in hand.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Work place</strong><br>Although all interns were given Chromebooks and a desktop, you could work from anywhere. The office was full of amazing places. There were a variety a rooms to hold meetings in adventurous ways, such as the rooms made of Bamboos or even the 'Spider-Man' room for the Marvel fans. You could even conduct your meeting in a car:<br><br><strong>Fun Event&nbsp;</strong><br>Google planned a fun event for the interns of Hyderabad and Bangalore in Bangalore where we had loads of fun and even built a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igjMYVTRvliApqePgvSiUYWPvLhpm9cs/view?usp=sharing \">roller-coaster ride</a>!<br><br><strong>Intern Connect Event&nbsp;</strong><br>Intern Connect Event was organised by Google interns in four cities - Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Mumbai and Bangalore. We kick-started with practice rounds assisted by Google Engineers, followed by some fun group activities organised by the Dance Company at Google.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Relaxing Environment&nbsp;</strong><br>There was not even a single day of Monday blues. You can soothe yourself with relaxing music being played in different areas of the office.&nbsp;<br>You could visit the steam room or the spa to relieve your tiredness. Google has a wide variety of massage therapies within the office. It was just superb! All the interns got 60 spa points.&nbsp;<br>If you would want to have a sound sleep to do away with the tire, you could use the facility of bunker beds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accommodation&nbsp;</strong><br>During the entire summer internship, all the Hyderabad interns stayed at Hyatt Gachibowli. Complimentary services included Laundry, Gym, Pool, Steam and Sauna.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Bi-Weekly Stand-ups&nbsp;</strong><br>Google doesn’t differentiate between a full-time employee and an intern. I was given a full-fledged project which included database management, front-end and back-end. I worked with each part of the Google internal stack. Doubts are inevitable when working with such brilliant technology. We received a great deal of help at every step. Regular updates with the team were shared in stand-up meetings. We always had someone from Singapore to join us in the stand-ups.</p><p><strong>Weekly Feedback&nbsp;</strong><br>Interns are usually anxious and often doubt if they are on the right track or not. To guide the interns and help them with their dilemmas, a meeting was organised with our manager weekly. I was lucky enough to get two mentors and two managers. It might daunt a newbie at first, but I was honestly very glad. We did a lot of design reviews together. Google has a collaborative structure and it focuses a lot upon Design Discussions. People often directly begin with the implementation and introduce refinements eventually. However in the industries, it’s just the opposite. You devote 60% of your time to software structure, planning&nbsp;<br>and design while 20% to testing and maintenance. Rest is given to the actual code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Work Culture&nbsp;</strong><br>Google has an open work culture. You can walk around anywhere and talk to anyone without any prior appointment or formalities. I always had lunch with my manager and mentors. This clearly goes to show how Google fosters a close-knit, homelike environment. You can also contact any team around the world whenever you wish to. I remember those days when I went to the director to discuss some new ideas for Google Pay. He was more than happy to have me on his desk.&nbsp;<br><br>There was a balanced work-life culture. We were told to work for 40 hours a week!

However, in the industries, it’s just the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p>You devote 60% of your time to software structure, planning and design while 20% to testing and maintenance. Rest is given to the actual code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Work Culture&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Google has an open work culture. You can walk around anywhere and talk to anyone without any prior appointment or formalities. I always had lunch with my manager and mentors. This clearly goes to show how Google fosters a close-knit, homelike environment. You can also contact any team around the world whenever you wish to. I remember those days when I went to the director to discuss some new ideas for Google Pay. He was more than happy to have me on his desk.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hVev3tl861ddYvfwDNkZYXdFwZK9vQJnHsWpH4rTkVKMtYsVx08iKIyQAnUT81UqnwKL3zUbVMc4Xe7V6RhGvkFWIJRq5taaSlgh2UF57ojhms9MZbxrWjRAzQGcTnmIwOzEAMLO\"></figure><blockquote><p><i>There was a balanced work-life culture.

You could even take Chromebooks on the nearby treadmills and exercise while you code! We had Indian swings, rickshaws, and slides too in the office. The atmosphere was very nostalgic and warm.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the workload, I didn’t really feel any. I had a lot of fun while working<strong> </strong>and yes, even while coding! We also had a poster session and a demonstration session to explain our design. It was just fun!&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed KK Verma, a member of Harvard Business Review, who was in DTU as a mentor for the Startup Weekend 19'.</i></p><p><strong>How has the journey been so multidimensional in terms of Airforce, then IIT, and now&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Harvard Business Review?&nbsp;</strong><br>The journey has been really spectacular. Ultimately, the product is me as a thinker and an&nbsp;<br>author, who has authored books on unlearning. We learn things, and I say that you must&nbsp;<br>unlearn your past experiences or habits or traditions so that you can acquire new ones. This&nbsp;<br>idea is not just for writing a book, I did it personally for the last 30 years. People around me&nbsp;<br>were not aware of electronics and computers, I did electronics engineering and I could do that&nbsp;<br>because of the habit of unlearning, because I realized the future is of electronics, even in the&nbsp;<br>1980s. Subsequently, I joined the Airforce to earn my bread and butter, I wanted to become an&nbsp;<br>officer too. Then I felt that 20 years is good enough and so I became an author. By that time I had enough resources and sustainability, my future was secured, so I took a leap of faith to become an author.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>How has this journey been personally, have there been any ups or downs, places where&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>you felt like you had to compromise in your career?&nbsp;</strong><br>Not only compromise but there's a very simple word. Life is brutal. You may feel like you go just down, to hell, but then if you are a person who understands technology and it's power. Even if you are going through a phase of down, you have the confidence of the power of technology, knowledge and wisdom. Every morning I get up and I maintain my schedule and discipline, I don’t play with my finances much as it is very risky, so keeping myself in a safe situation where I can survive even if the toughest thing happens. But down or up is always an integral part of life.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>You too have been through this engineering phase, you must know the life of 8 AM&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>lectures and completing our assignments at the last moment. We as a generation have&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>issues with discipline, and you having worked in careers that require great work ethic,&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>how do you recommend we work on it?&nbsp;</strong><br>Pesonally, I feel that we have an advantage over any other profession because we know the technology, and technology is an integral part of growth. In the 90s and 2000s we have seen that engineers can do business inmillions. Narayan Murthy, Nandan Nilekani all are stellarexamples. We have seen how engineers can do great things. Nandan Nilekani was the originator of Aadhar, he led the groundwork for making the Aadhar Card IDs universal.<br>Engineers have lead from the front in the last decade, and in the days to come, engineers are&nbsp;<br>going to lead. I was an air force pilot and I have seen my fair share of politics, but engineers&nbsp;<br>must grow and change their profession, go to the managerial level then go to the supervisor&nbsp;<br>level then go to mentor level and finally go at the driving level, leading new projects.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>It is often claimed that everything you learn in your 4 years of engineering will become redundant&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>down the line due to new technological advancements. For you to be in touch with this profession, you need to be constantly learning. How true is this statement in the real world today?&nbsp;</strong><br>No, I don’t think that this holds any truth. As someone who has worked closely with the concept of&nbsp;<br>Unlearning and authored 3 books on it, I believe that what we need is to know more than just the basic&nbsp;<br>skills. As engineers, our learning of different things must continue. The focus should not be on merely&nbsp;<br>acquiring knowledge, but more so on learning new and varied things that would encourage and enable&nbsp;<br>future growth. It’s completely right to state that things get outdated after a while. Certain statistics&nbsp;<br>predict that 90% of the companies that are functioning currently might vanish in a few years and be&nbsp;<br>replaced by new ones that have overthrown them, simply because they have different and more&nbsp;<br>advanced skills. For students, it thus becomes integral to study and learn new things. Keep unlearning&nbsp;<br>anything that has become redundant and find new sources of information. Anyone who is attached to&nbsp;<br>old methods can’t progress and prosper, for it is only through acquiring new skills that we can keep&nbsp;<br>moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>A current trend amongst engineering students seems to be that of switching careers from something technical to more financially rewarding fields. Why do you think this switch has become so popular?&nbsp;</strong><br>This is how society has always functioned. A normal part of human evolution is to always go for&nbsp;<br>something better, and to constantly improve ourselves. When I did engineering, I thought it was the&nbsp;<br>best thing to do. However, your vision broadens as you discover more beneficial prospects. If I feel that&nbsp;<br>doing an MBA is better, then I would do join an MBA program. If I feel that running a&nbsp;<br>company is even better, then I will switch to entrepreneurship. The only difference in this case&nbsp;<br>being, my wisdom domain will come into play. One thing we must keep in mind is awareness about&nbsp;<br>our ‘wisdom domains’, so that the knowledge we acquire does not go to waste.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>How has the journey been as a member of Harvard Business Review, one of the most&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>established business review columns?&nbsp;</strong><br>In 2005, when I left the Indian Air Force, there was one institution called, Indian Society for&nbsp;<br>Training and Development, which called me and offered me to become a faculty there. I wish&nbsp;<br>that more and more Indian Institutions followed this uncommon trend. However, HBR, having&nbsp;<br>noted my presence online, invited me to become a member. They noticed me largely because&nbsp;<br>of my articles, present on my blog. In India, this approach is hardly followed. Due to this, a large&nbsp;<br>pool of Indian talent is not valued. Talking about HBR, it has been a great journey. I am&nbsp;<br>responsible for choosing topics and the mode of operation, all over the world.&nbsp;<br>I am also coaching my daughter squash. Even though I am not a professional squash player or&nbsp;<br>a coach, with help of human excellence through unlearning, I have helped her become India’s&nbsp;<br>Number 3 squash player.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Why do fields like Environment, Finance, etc. get more funding from economic&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>institutions like the World Bank, as compared to core engineering fields?&nbsp;</strong><br>I believe this is due to a global phenomenon, over which we have no control. Hence, I advise&nbsp;<br>engineers not to get affected by it. If your heart is in a field and you can imagine yourself&nbsp;<br>enjoying after being 15-20 years in that field, then you should definitely pursue it. My advice to&nbsp;<br>today’s engineers is, to have a well-settled life, for at least 10 or 20 years. While doing so, enjoy&nbsp;<br>the other aspects of life. Do not try to build your life in a day or two. Make a long-term plan and&nbsp;<br>find the right advisors. If we follow this approach, then I am sure one will have a successful life.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>What knowledge from your branch played a key role during the interview?&nbsp;</strong><br>Knowledge from my branch definitely played a pivotal role during the entire interview process. I was rigorously grilled on almost all computer based subjects whether operating systems, database, data structures or algorithms thus the knowledge gathered during classroom study and lucid explanation of concepts helped grasp them better and proved to be pivotal in cracking the interview rounds. The questions ranged from basic concepts of these subjects to complex brain storming questions thus in a nutshell the curriculum that has been designed for our branch is totally up to the mark to help the aspirants for interview preparation.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>How did your internships influence your decision of applying for the company?&nbsp;</strong><br>Internship plays a key role in deciding which companies to apply for as the organisation we intern at gives us the much needed exposure to technology and the stack that they use. We are able to identify our real interests that may or may not match the job descriptions of every company visiting the campus. Secondly the work culture of the organisation we intern at impacts our future choices as every company has predefined set of ethics and varies in work culture. We get a crystal clear picture of the working environment that suits our mindset and we are to do a selective filtering based on that. The tools and technology that we use in that organisation add to our skillset that helps us to shortlist relevant companies in the future.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>If a person has a natural aptitude or skills for a certain non tech company but doesn't have a lot of project history in his/her CV to back it up, what's the procedure to go about it?&nbsp;</strong><br>Showing interest in the organisation is very important for securing a placement. If you have a non-tech aptitude but lack relevant projects in CV first of all you should be prepared to be grilled on the reason for the same. You should know in and out about the work organisation does, products they deal in and how you can add value to that organisation. You should be able to convince the interviewer that how your aptitude and know how can be utilized in a fruitful manner. Keep yourself updated with current affairs and your personal viewpoints on things happening around.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What made Sprinklr stand out among its competitors for you?&nbsp;</strong><br>Sprinklr is clearly one of the best organisation in its domain and the skills that they demand particularly data structures and algorithms are at par with technical giants and quite above the similar organisations. It has exceptional work culture that is employee friendly and work conditions are quiet flexible and favourable. The monetary benefits that it offers are worth going for and as far as I gathered after reading employee experiences, their work is quite demanding and the exposure to new cutting edge technologies is a usual part of the organisation that enhances the skill set of the employee and makes them stand out in a crowd.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What kind of internships should students prefer? The ones with higher stipends or the ones that offer more exposure and learning experience?&nbsp;</strong><br>Clearly internships are nothing but the first learning experience for a student, different from college life where they come in close contact with the working of multi national companies, their code of conduct, various parameters of project delivery, strenuous guidelines, stress handling etc. Stipend is not at all a major factor that should govern your selection criteria . The internship should be such that it adds something to your skillset, project should be relevant to the products and services the company deal with and exposure should be maximal. During your internship you should be a key element in at least one major project the company is working upon because that will give you legit exposure to the working methodology of the organisation.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What are you planning to do this year to better prepare yourself for your job next year?&nbsp;</strong><br>Being a computer science student my entire focus will be on mastering data structures and algorithms because they form the core of any interview. Advanced data structures are usually neglected by most of the students that sometimes hinder your selection so I will try to get deep into ADS and advanced algorithms to brighten up my chances for future endeavours. Keeping myself updated with latest technology trends will also be my priority.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What are some skills that every student should work on, regardless of whether he wants a technical placement or a non technical placement?&nbsp;</strong><br>Each company irrespective of their domain demands good communication skills. You should be lucid, fluent and convincing to an extent that you are able to prove your viewpoints quiet well. Secondly you should be well versed in your resume. Your projects and internships must be on your tips. Thirdly you need to make a nexus with the interviewer. You need to keep him engaged in your conversation. Read about the organisation well. You need to show that you are interested in that particular organisation and you need to supplement it with appropriate reasons.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>",

In the 90s and 2000s we have seen that engineers can do business in millions. Narayan Murthy and Nandan Nilekani all are stellar examples. We have seen how engineers can do great things. Nandan Nilekani was the originator of Aadhar; he led the groundwork for making the Aadhar Card IDs universal.<br>Engineers have lead from the front in the last decade, and in the days to come, engineers are going to lead. I was an air force pilot and I have seen my fair share of politics, but engineers<br>must grow and change their profession, go to the managerial level then go to the supervisor level then go to mentor level and finally go at the driving level, leading new projects.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>It is often claimed that everything you learn in your 4 years of engineering will become redundant down the line due to new technological advancements. For you to be in touch with this profession, you need to be constantly learning. How true is this statement in the real world today?&nbsp;</strong><br>No, I don’t think that this holds any truth. As someone who has worked closely with the concept of Unlearning and authored 3 books on it, I believe that what we need is to know more than just the basic skills. As engineers, our learning of different things must continue. The focus should not be on merely acquiring knowledge, but more so on learning new and varied things that would encourage and enable future growth. It’s completely right to state that things get outdated after a while. Certain statistics predict that 90% of the companies that are functioning currently might vanish in a few years and be replaced by new ones that have overthrown them, simply because they have different and more advanced skills. For students, it thus becomes integral to study and learn new things. Keep unlearning anything that has become redundant and find new sources of information. Anyone who is attached to old methods can’t progress and prosper, for it is only through acquiring new skills that we can keep moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>A current trend amongst engineering students seems to be that of switching careers from something technical to more financially rewarding fields. Why do you think this switch has become so popular?&nbsp;</strong><br>This is how society has always functioned. A normal part of human evolution is to always go for something better, and to constantly improve ourselves. When I did engineering, I thought it was the best thing to do. However, your vision broadens as you discover more beneficial prospects. If I feel that doing an MBA is better, then I would do join an MBA program. If I feel that running a company is even better, then I will switch to entrepreneurship. The only difference in this case being, my wisdom domain will come into play. One thing we must keep in mind is awareness about our ‘wisdom domains’, so that the knowledge we acquire does not go to waste.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>How has the journey been as a member of Harvard Business Review, one of the most&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>established business review columns?&nbsp;</strong><br>In 2005, when I left the Indian Air Force, there was one institution called, Indian Society for Training and Development, which called me and offered me to become a faculty there. I wish that more and more Indian Institutions followed this uncommon trend. However, HBR, having noted my presence online, invited me to become a member. They noticed me largely because of my articles, present on my blog. In India, this approach is hardly followed. Due to this, a large pool of Indian talent is not valued. Talking about HBR, it has been a great journey. I am responsible for choosing topics and the mode of operation, all over the world. I am also coaching my daughter squash. Even though I am not a professional squash player or a coach, with help of human excellence through unlearning, I have helped her become India’s Number 3 squash player.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Why do fields like Environment, Finance, etc. get more funding from economic&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>institutions like the World Bank, as compared to core engineering fields?&nbsp;</strong><br>I believe this is due to a global phenomenon, over which we have no control. Hence, I advise engineers not to get affected by it. If your heart is in a field and you can imagine yourself enjoying after being 15-20 years in that field, then you should definitely pursue it. My advice to today’s engineers is, to have a well-settled life, for at least 10 or 20 years. While doing so, enjoy the other aspects of life. Do not try to build your life in a day or two. Make a long-term plan and find the right advisors. If we follow this approach, then I am sure one will have a successful life.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Milind Sahay, Electronics and Communication Engineering, who secured a placement at Flipkart.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Flipkart is one of the dream companies for many. When was it, when you became confident of securing an offer at a company like Flipkart? What was your roadmap for this journey?</strong></p><p>To be honest, I was never really certain that I could bag an offer with a company like Flipkart. This uncertainty is amazing as you strive to get better and better with the resources in hand.</p><p>I had Engineering drawing in my 12th std. and therefore, never really had any exposure to programming. I even scored a 20 (out of 50) in C programming, a subject we were taught during our first year. I was completely clueless till my 4th semester. Then, I reached out to some seniors, looking for some help regarding the future prospects. Gradually, things became clearer and I started practicing programming and tried to explore other branches related to it.</p><p>Internship season arrived and I did not get into what one can term as a ‘tier 1’ company. Still, I tried to focus part of my day into programming. Also, the company at which I interned really helped me, because along with relevant projects, I was offered flexible work hours. This does prove that every cloud does have a silver lining. Eventually, things worked out for me wonderfully. It’s quite essential that you have a supportive and understanding peer group and a bunch of amazing seniors to reach out to, an aspect, I was very fortunate with.</p><p><strong>Quite a few students do not get involve with development, competitive programming or any other track even till the start of 4th semester (and start slipping into anxiety due to the same reason). What would you suggest to them? What remedial measures can they take against the racing clock?</strong></p><p>It is very easy to get intimidated by looking at people around you and what they are up to. We need to realise that everybody has a different clock; some start late, while some start early, some grasp things easily, while some take more time for things to digest. Therefore, it is very essential to not let anxiety get to your nerves. Try to have a goal initially and then, take steps to realise that goal steadily. I believe that it’s perfectly fine if you start late while having a specific goal in mind than blindly hitting at random opportunities.</p><p><strong>Which technical skill helped you the most? What was the magnitude of the difference it made on your CV?</strong></p><p>I started exploring the field of Machine Learning soon after I started programming and hence, I believe it had a major contribution in my internship as well as placement season. Only a handful of companies visited our campus for the profile of ‘Data Science Intern’ and of all those which did, each of them rigorously checked candidates on their machine learning and data science knowledge. I was fortunate enough to get into one of those firms as I really enjoyed my time there and eventually, this whole exercise helped me during my placement season.</p><p><strong>Would you rather choose a CV detailed with one of the following: AI, competitive programming, or, development; or, a CV comprising of a combination of these skills?</strong></p><p>As for me, I had AI with a hint of competitive programming in my CV. It’s very essential not to lie on your CV as interviewers can detect the same in a jiffy, which maligns your chances. You can also try to align your CV with the profiles the visiting company has to offer. The most important thing is that you should be able to explain each and every part of your CV. Generally, we ourselves are responsible for driving our interviews.</p><p><strong>What effect does it make on placements if one doesn’t find himself an internship at an A+ company?</strong></p><p>Getting an internship is tougher than getting a placement as companies which visit for full time opportunities are far more in number. Therefore, people easily lose confidence. The key is not to lose hope. Not getting an internship at an A+ company does not mean that you do not possess what it takes. Rather, you can devote all of your time and energy into placement preparations. Devoting your time and working hard towards the goal you have in mind, is solely the most critical thing you can do to achieve it. If you’ve worked hard, you’ll be rewarded eventually.</p><p><strong>If there was one advice you could give to your freshman self, what would it be?</strong></p><p>My advice would be to start exploring things from the very start. If you do not explore, you’ll never know where your interests lie. Try to devote some part of the day, however little, to the goal on which you have set your eyes on. I truly believe that consistency is the key and that failures are a part of life. It’s fairly essential to believe in yourself and never lose hope. Always remember, you may face failures a thousand times, but you only need to succeed that one time.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Amit Gupta, Vice President, MasterCard, who was in DTU as a judge for the Startup Weekend organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How do you think electronic wallets and UPI have affected banking in the credit card industry?</strong></p><p>You should think of it as a payment device or a payment mechanism. In the past, as you know, we’ve progressed from a lot of people using cash, then cards, and then wallets. Now the government is making things like UPI very, very open and thereby pushing the digital agenda. Still, what’s happening in the market is that <strong>84%</strong> of all the transactions still take place through cash, in India. That’s a lot. If you look at the numbers of how much cash is withdrawn, 85% of all that is spent through card is on ATM in terms of withdrawing more cash. 500 billion dollars of cash is withdrawn in India and only 85-90 billion dollars is spent through card, on merchants directly. Now what’s happening is that with the invention of UPI as well as wallets, people are becoming more tech savvy and digital transactions are growing, enabling safer, faster, and secured transactions. So, if you look at UPI, it makes things seem easy. For example, what PayTM is doing is making things very convenient for the users. At the end, it is helping the consumers and obviously making the entire system digital, which is more efficient.</p><p><strong>Before studying at IIM Lucknow, you were an Electronics engineer. What exactly moved you to go towards the field of business and how did your experience as an engineer assist you in this field?</strong></p><p>Even when I did my engineering, my focus may not have been on electronics but more on the technology aspect. When I got the opportunity to work in Corporate, be it TCS and then later with American Express, I realized that there is a great need for every individual to have a holistic view on how a business works. Having technical abilities is certainly good but understanding business is also important, which means having the fundamentals of finance, marketing, strategy and operations. This is the key to understanding the broader aspect of how things are done and obviously it’ll help you understand and learn things in a better way. Also, the exposure you get post MBA- having good technical skills, good experience- is valuable. An MBA not only teaches you the fundamentals of business, but it also helps you understand the value of creating networks- the value of understanding and collaborating by working in teams. It helps you know how well you can do things by not only knowing the product or the technical aspect but also by understanding the economics behind it.</p><p><strong>Right now you’re surrounded by engineers who are aspiring to be entrepreneurs, who don’t exactly have that much management exposure or exposure to the workings of a business. What could students these days do to increase their exposure in this field?</strong></p><p>One thing is that they should read more, they should have a passion for innovation, and a passion for creating value. This value can be in the form of a product or a business, but they must have passion and a curiosity to understand the problems being faced. Once someone is curious, then only will the person be able to come up with a solution. So, to create a business solution, what’s important is the pressing need and post that, having a feasible solution for that pressing need. Once you’re able to do that, then there are other aspects- having the right economics and business model in place and the idea of how you can go to the market. I advise that students should learn the fundamentals of how things happen, should interact a lot with professors, peers, industry members. The college should also focus more on industry interaction- bringing in more industry people so that students will have more exposure. I think that’s the only thing lacking. For bright minds, very hardworking and self-driven people, the only thing required is exposure- such forums will certainly provide them with exposure. And then with time and experience people will learn how to prepare a robust and a well-balanced business plan.</p><p><strong>Nowadays there’s a lot of talk about cryptocurrency and blockchain in the current economy. What do you think are the potential impacts of this technology?</strong></p><p>Blockchain is great as a concept. What it does is create blocks which are attached to the last block so that you know the sequencing. There’s a third party which acts as a regulating party and everything is linked with a history, so it is easy to track. Cryptocurrency is a challenging thing because there is no regulator. When you’re given a note- a physical note- the RBI Governor says that I promise to pay you that amount. No one can say no to it because the RBI Governor will pay in the end. But since cryptocurrency has no regulator, you don’t know who will pay in case of a dispute. Therefore, the Government of India and a lot of other governments are against cryptocurrencies. If you don’t have a regulator, you can’t have something which can buy because at the end you need someone who can manage the disputes</p><p><strong>Any tips or advice for the current engineering students in the college?</strong></p><p>Be curious, have the passion in the right place. Do not just blindly follow what’s going on, understand the fundamentals, understand the value behind whatever is being done and since they’re bright minds, the world is waiting with open arms for them.</p>",

The questions ranged from basic concepts of these subjects to complex brainstorming questions. Thus, in a nutshell, the curriculum that has been designed for our branch is totally up to the mark to help the aspirants for interview preparation.</p><p><strong>How did your internships influence your decision of applying for the company?</strong></p><p>Internship plays a key role in deciding which companies to apply for as the organisation we intern at gives us the much-needed exposure to the technology stack that they use. We can identify our real interests that may or may not match the job descriptions of every company visiting the campus.

The ones with higher stipends or the ones that offer more exposure and learning experience?</strong></p><p>Internships are nothing but the first learning experience for a student, different from college life where they come in close contact with the working of multinational companies, their code of conduct, various parameters of project delivery, strenuous guidelines, stress handling, etc. Stipend is not at all major factors that should govern your selection criteria. The internship should be such that it adds something to your skill set, the project should be relevant to the products and services the company deal with and exposure should be maximal.

    "slug": "editorial-the-absurdity-behind-the-iit-mtech-fee-hike-857",
    "body": "<ul><li><strong>- Shivam Jha, Editor-in-Chief</strong></li></ul><p>In times like these, where academic news serves nothing but indifference to the public that has been deeply embroiled in the regular, irascible media 'debates' on a specific temple, the minute-by-minute reportage of the actions of a specific person in power and peculiarly the activities of a specific neighbouring country, a recent announcement seemed to garner above-average attention amongst the youth.</p><p>The IIT Council, led by the Union HRD Minister, had recommended that all IITs would charge<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/mtech-fee-hiked-to-discourage-non-serious-students-hrd-ministry/articleshow/71364101.cms?from=mdr\"> tuition fee of 2,00,000 for M.Tech programmes</a> which would be at par with the B.Tech fee structure, which is a hike of up to <strong>900%. </strong>Alongside this, the provision of stipend of 12,400 monthly to the students for part-time teaching assistance has also been revoked. It is to be noted that the fee hike for M.Tech courses will be implemented gradually over the next few years and each IIT will take a call as to how much the fees should be increased in each year.</p><blockquote><p>It is being claimed that the fee hike is targeted at students who drop out midway from the M.Tech course, however, it is being applied to all the students irrespective of their academic rigour or planned intent of dropping out (or lack thereof). The council has failed to justify why a blanket hike would rationalise placing such a financial burden on all prospective students.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rao.ramgopal/posts/10218188716681820\">IIT Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao on his recent Facebook post </a>supported the decision calling it a <i><strong>“surgical strike” on “uninterested students”.</strong></i> I find it appalling that a person at this position is using such vocabulary. These words belong to the political stages where political stooges and our policymakers compete with gorillas in chest-thumping. For stopping 'non-serious students' entering into the PG programme, hiking fees and revoking stipend is <strong>not the right way</strong>, rather it is an <strong>easy way </strong>to opt and implement.</p><p>With due respect, I believe the rationale behind the decision and its justification, both are fundamentally flawed on multiple parameters.</p><p>Mr. Rao assumes large US universities generate major revenue from Masters students and uses this as a benchmark in his clarification. There isn't much data supporting that. Harvard, for example, generates 10% of its total revenue from the graduate students. That includes funded masters and almost always funded Ph.D. students, who, of course, are not paying out of their own pockets.</p><p>The council has announced that they recognise the courses are lagging behind the international standards but can't restructure the courses until the pay hike is implemented. I sincerely hope they realise how <strong>ridiculous</strong> that sounds. Also, it is completely ludicrous why you need a financial motivation to change something you feel is inherently wrong and detrimental to the higher education system.</p><p>This problem arises because B.Tech undergraduates from IITs are the first preference for the high salary paying MNCs. M.Tech students are mostly recruited by same companies that visit the IITs for placement without any exceptional difference in their packages. Even in the government sector, M.Tech students exclusively get only a handful of opportunities as JRF/ SRF's for a fixed no. of years. So their road finally leads to <strong>either dropping out </strong>for the dire need to secure a job <strong>or a Ph.D. </strong>degree, with/without interest/experience in research. Thus, when M.Tech from IITs doesn't provide brighter opportunities as compared with that of B.Tech from the same institute, how and why should they both be put at the same pedestal when it comes to fee structuring?</p><blockquote><p>He said that this will fix the problem of wastage of much sought-after seats at IITs and save government funds and added that if students were willing to pay ₹20 lakh for an MBA degree in an IIM, they can surely pay ₹4 lakh for a masters degree in IITs. <i><strong>“Nobody drops out of IIMs since they see a value in IIM-MBA programmes. On the other hand, we see over 50% dropouts in IIT M.Tech programmes.\"&nbsp;</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>But has the council even tried to<strong> introspect why students are dropping out? </strong>They are willing to conveniently blame it on the <strong>'lack of seriousness' </strong>in the students without taking into account the<strong> lack in the coursework, research infrastructure, industry synchronisation </strong>that plagues this degree. Students quit as soon as they find a job outside because this programme has failed to provide them with any additional value to their skill set or professional expertise, let along guaranteeing them a occupational stability post completion.</p><p>A large number of top ranking students drop out within the first year because PSUs hire students after the admission process has been completed and no student in their sane minds will let go a <i>sarkari</i> job in India. The solution isn't raising fees to attract sincere students but <strong>fix the admission - hiring sequence.</strong></p><p>Another point which has been raised is the catalysis of the <i><strong>'brain-drain' </strong></i>that these academic councils so lament upon. If a sincere candidate will have to pay an exorbitant fee for a Masters program anyway, what motivation does he have left to choose an IIT over pursuing it from a top university abroad?Without putting the course at par with the highly ranked institutions worldwide, the council is <strong>comfortably shifting the burden to the students.</strong></p><p>Why isn't a considerable hike in PhD scholarships (at the end of 3 years, maybe) a part of this plan if the vision is to raise money from masters students and provide that as incentives for PhD programs? Why is the option of getting students to sign a <strong>bond</strong> to deter them from dropping out instead of the outright uniform fee hike considered? Further, there isn't an iota of information regarding where the money will be spent.</p><p>The IIT Council seems to be worried about wasting taxpayer’s money. I agree wholeheartedly. But what exactly has MHRD done to solve that problem?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, IITs need to produce excellent Ph.Ds without wasting taxpayer money. Some of them are already doing that. But you can't produce top researchers in five years however much you improve your institution. <strong>The tree is rotten at the root</strong>. The undergrad research scenario in the country is gruesome, barring the IITs and some state schools. We all know that. Instead of appealing for that to be changed, you seem to support dissolving a system that helps the under-prepared, underexposed students to make informed career decision without putting a significant financial burden on them. It is both deeply saddening and shocking. Hope you find the opportunity to do a thorough introspection.<br><br>There has been a <strong>rapid withdrawal of State funding</strong> from educational institutions accompanied by privatisation of education which is gaining its momentum keeping pace with foreign investments and corporate franchise. Even the present fee hike should be seen in this context of the manifestation of fund-cuts.<br><br>The rich can now buy education, and perhaps fill up the seats which the other sections cannot afford. This system will create a <strong>two-fold problem.</strong><br><br>Firstly, the number of people who will have to take education loans will increase immensely. This means that a potential number of students will graduate with a <strong>ready economic handicap</strong>. The cyclical loan process of higher education will force the candidate to go for job to clear that loan and leaving little scope of pursuing his/her dream. Suppose now that dream is higher studies, the increased fee and no stipend will decrease his willingness to study further as most of the students in our country are looked to support their families after graduation. Taking loan again for M.Tech will entrap the student again in the vicious cycle of loans.</p><p>Secondly, imposing strict financial restrictions have adverse cascading effects as the talent at the core of the nation will remain untapped and deprived of opportunity.<br><br>Instead, if they continue to smother students through sky rocketing fee hikes and policies intended to exclude those coming from deprived sections, the higher education system will be at the onset of becoming a rigged game where you have to belong to a layer, belong to the choicest few to even get a chance to roll the dice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Shruti Bansal, Computer Engineering, Class of 2020 who secured a placement at Sprinklr.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What knowledge from your branch played a key role during the interview?</strong></p><p>Knowledge from my branch definitely played a pivotal role during the entire interview process. I was rigorously grilled on almost all computer-based subjects whether operating systems, database, data structures or algorithms; the knowledge gathered during classroom study and lucid explanation of concepts that helped grasp them better proved to be essential in cracking the interview rounds. The questions ranged from basic concepts of these subjects to complex brainstorming questions. Thus, in a nutshell, the curriculum that has been designed for our branch is totally up to the mark to help the aspirants for interview preparation.</p><p><strong>How did your internships influence your decision of applying for the company?</strong></p><p>Internship plays a key role in deciding which companies to apply for as the organisation we intern at gives us the much-needed exposure to the technology stack that they use. We can identify our real interests that may or may not match the job descriptions of every company visiting the campus. Secondly, the work culture of the organisation we intern at impacts our future choices as every company has a predefined set of ethics and varies in work culture. We get a crystal clear picture of the working environment that suits our mindset and we are to do a selective filtering based on that. The tools and technology that we use in that organisation add to our skill set that helps us to shortlist relevant companies in the future.</p><p><strong>If a person has a natural aptitude or skills for a certain non-tech company but doesn't have a lot of project history in his/her CV to back it up, what's the procedure to go about it?</strong></p><p>Showing interest in the organisation is very important for securing a placement. If you have a non-tech aptitude but lack relevant projects in CV, first of all, you should be prepared to be grilled on the reason for the same. You should know in and out about the work organisation does, products they deal in and how you can add value to that organisation. You should be able to convince the interviewer that how your aptitude. Keep yourself updated with current affairs and your viewpoints on things happening around.</p><p><strong>What made Sprinklr stand out among its competitors for you?</strong></p><p>Sprinklr is one of the best organisations in its domain and the skills that they demand particularly in data structures and algorithms are at par with the technical giants and quite above similar organisations. It has an exceptional work culture that is employee-friendly and work conditions are quite flexible and favorable. The monetary benefits that it offers are worth going for and as far as I gathered after reading employee experiences that work is quite demanding and the exposure to new cutting edge technologies is a usual part of the organisation that enhances the skill set of the employee and makes him stand out in a crowd.</p><p><strong>What kind of internships should students prefer? The ones with higher stipends or the ones that offer more exposure and learning experience?</strong></p><p>Internships are nothing but the first learning experience for a student, different from college life where they come in close contact with the working of multinational companies, their code of conduct, various parameters of project delivery, strenuous guidelines, stress handling, etc. Stipend is not at all major factors that should govern your selection criteria. The internship should be such that it adds something to your skill set, the project should be relevant to the products and services the company deal with and exposure should be maximal. During your internship, you should be a key element in at least one major project the company is working upon because that will give you legit exposure to the working methodology of the organisation.</p><p><strong>What are you planning to do this year to better prepare yourself for your job next year?</strong></p><p>Being a computer science student my entire focus will be on mastering data structures and algorithms because they form the core of any interview. Advanced data structures are usually neglected by most of the students that sometimes hinder your selection so I will try to get deep into ADS and advanced algorithms to brighten up my chances for future endeavors. Keeping myself updated with latest technology trends will also be my priority.</p><p><strong>What are some skills that every student should work on, regardless of whether he wants a technical placement or a non-technical placement?</strong></p><p>Each company irrespective of its domain demands good communication skills. You should be lucid, fluent and convincing to an extent that you can prove your viewpoints quiet well. Secondly you should be well versed in your resume. Your projects and internships must be on your tips. Thirdly you need to make a nexus with the interviewer. You need to keep him engaged in your conversation. Read about the organisation well. You need to show that you are interested in that particular organisation and you need to supplement it with appropriate reasons.</p>",

Read on as Anushka Sharma, 3rd year, MAM and Anoushka Raj, 2nd year, ENE recall the warm welcome that the star received on campus.</p><p><strong>On 14 September 2019, when Sushant Singh Rajput first posted his list of 50 dreams, including one to visit his alma mater, Delhi College of Engineering, little was he aware of the wave of euphoria he inspired in the entire DCE community. The homecoming of a star always infuses in students a sense of anticipation, but nobody expected that a pleasant Sunday morning would turn into such a memorable day for hoards of DTUites. The last day of the mid-semester exams might have started with the general weariness that accompanies exam season, but then random pictures of a homegrown star walking around in a green jacket and cargo pants started doing the rounds! In what seemed like a split second, a huge crowd of DTUites from every year was thrown off their study schedules and teleported right next to ‘The Sushant Singh Rajput’. Sushant was seen smiling his way through crowds of enthusiastic students, flanked by his crew and journalists. The actor, whose latest film Chhichhore crossed the 100 crore mark, was seen being as modest as ever as he shook hands with the pupils and got clicked with some of the luckier ones.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The urge to return to simpler life, which revolves around routine and structure, the familiar stench of regularity, of waking up at a set hour and heading to class, the joy of participating in events, the unplanned adventures that give you a rush of adrenaline; college is perhaps a palette of mixed emotions that you don’t encounter at other points of life. The nostalgic yearning for uncomplicated times is what brings even the most successful individuals back to where they started. Our roots become the platform on which all future accomplishments are built, and to come back to the beginning with a sense of pride seems to be a beautiful yet humbling experience.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>From playing the critically-acclaimed and publically hailed lead role in soap opera Pavitra Rishta, to being a household name after his stellar role in Kai Po Che, Sushant has many credits to his name. But even years of disconnection do not take away the pride of belonging to Delhi Technological University. Any desk you scribble on, any bench of the OAT wherein you sat soaking the Sun while fervently working on your assignments, any secret nooks and crannies that you use for photoshoots- all the little places inside campus are places where your idols might have made similar memories. There is something about the pull of college that keeps bringing people back so often, and with so much pride.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Sushant seemed to be fondly recollecting all the college hotspots such as Library and MechC, and after his visit to MechC, was seen asking about the night canteen.

Read on as Anushka Sharma, 3rd year, MAM and Anoushka Raj, 2nd year, ENE recall the warm welcome that the star received on campus.</i></p><p>On 14 September 2019, when Sushant Singh Rajput first posted his list of 50 dreams, including one to visit his alma mater, Delhi College of Engineering, little was he aware of the wave of euphoria he inspired in the entire DCE community. The homecoming of a star always infuses in students a sense of anticipation, but nobody expected that a pleasant Sunday morning would turn into such a memorable day for hoards of DTUites. The last day of the mid-semester exams might have started with the general weariness that accompanies exam season, but then random pictures of a homegrown star walking around in a green jacket and cargo pants started doing the rounds! In what seemed like a split second, a huge crowd of DTUites from every year was thrown off their study schedules and teleported right next to ‘The Sushant Singh Rajput’. Sushant was seen smiling his way through crowds of enthusiastic students, flanked by his crew and journalists. The actor, whose latest film Chhichhore crossed the 100 crore mark, was seen being as modest as ever as he shook hands with the pupils and got clicked with some of the luckier ones.&nbsp;</p><p>The urge to return to simpler life, which revolves around routine and structure, the familiar stench of regularity, of waking up at a set hour and heading to class, the joy of participating in events, the unplanned adventures that give you a rush of adrenaline; college is perhaps a palette of mixed emotions that you don’t encounter at other points of life. The nostalgic yearning for uncomplicated times is what brings even the most successful individuals back to where they started. Our roots become the platform on which all future accomplishments are built, and to come back to the beginning with a sense of pride seems to be a beautiful yet humbling experience.&nbsp;</p><p>From playing the critically-acclaimed and publically hailed lead role in soap opera Pavitra Rishta, to being a household name after his stellar role in Kai Po Che, Sushant has many credits to his name. But even years of disconnection do not take away the pride of belonging to Delhi Technological University. Any desk you scribble on, any bench of the OAT wherein you sat soaking the Sun while fervently working on your assignments, any secret nooks and crannies that you use for photoshoots- all the little places inside campus are places where your idols might have made similar memories. There is something about the pull of college that keeps bringing people back so often, and with so much pride.&nbsp;</p><p>Sushant seemed to be fondly recollecting all the college hotspots such as Library and MechC, and after his visit to MechC, was seen asking about the night canteen. Highlight of the visit however, seems to be the subtle affection displayed by our ever favourite Chandan Bhaiya, who never fails to disappoint. The enormous turnout that his visit inspired, almost turned this surprise visit into a live set of Chhichhore. Sushant Singh Rajput stated that one of the reasons he took up Chhichore was to relive his college days,and hostel life experienced at DCE.&nbsp;</p><p>He seemed to be overwhelmed by the warmth and love offered by fellow DTUites who followed every step of his reminiscent return. “All of you all is me, and all of me are you all” - read his gratitude post after the successful completion of a day trip to his Alma Mater, thus ticking off the twelfth dream in his wishlist</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>In a time when data has become more valuable than oil, Angad Sethi, 2nd year, COE, pens down his concerns and worries as to how data mining undermines the fundamental right to privacy and leaves us all vulnerable.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“घर का भेदी लंका ढाये” is a phrase which we have heard often enough. If Vibhishana, who was the real brother of Ravana, could betray him, I wonder how did we even think of placing our trust with money minting organizations like Google, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, when they “assured” us that our darkest secrets, most gratifying acts or our misdeeds would remain private. Ravana, who was unparalleled in his wisdom and knowledge, and was on the verge of winning the war and being remembered forever, now gets blown to smithereens every year, only because Vibhishana spilled the beans. So, in today’s digital era, how secret are our secrets?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On 2nd&nbsp;October 2019, the London’s Court of Appeal gave the go-ahead for action against Google over claims it collected data from more than 4 million iPhone users, overturning a ruling in 2018 that in effect blocked any route to legal redress. In 2018, Facebook was directed to pay five billion dollars as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission - by far the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumers' privacy rights. Khaled Saad once said, “If you give your trust to a person who does not deserve it, you actually give him the power to destroy you”, and technological giants like Google and Facebook have proved this adage to be true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I first heard that Facebook sold the data of millions of citizens, I couldn’t have cared less. What information could someone possibly gather about me from my date of birth or my previous education? But a slew of articles on the internet introduced me to the term “data mining”. For the uninitiated, data mining is the practice of examining large databases in order to generate new information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Data mining had at one time been hailed as the holy grail of the technological revolution. The government and the private sector alike, rejoiced at the acquisition of this new tool. Governmental agencies could analyse the databases of their citizens, single out the irregularities and take corrective action. National security, at last, seemed just within grasp. For the private sector, the possibilities seemed endless. Advertising and targeted marketing being just the tip of the iceberg. Companies were now able to predict their customers’ needs and interests, and act accordingly. If you searched for funny dog videos, Amazon would make sure you had all the dog food, dog shampoos and soap you needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, this fairy tale doesn’t have a happy ending. This utopian paradise soon came crashing down on its creators. People realised that data mining, at its very core, is an assault on the fundamental right to privacy. This problem was brought to the spotlight, by the issue that triggered the long overdue discussion on the ethics of data mining, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal. The controversy over data mining really picked up steam when it was discovered that Cambridge Analytica had paid Facebook for access to the data of over 50 million US Citizens in preparation for the 2016 US election. Since then, Facebook has drawn consistent criticism for its data mining practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then came the damage-control-chorus of the technological companies, chanting that “Your data is private” or “All identifying features have been scrubbed off”. However, in a study conducted by MIT scientists and urban planners, it was shown that it’s fairly simple to figure out the identities of the citizens. In other words, anonymized data could be deanonymized pretty quickly when working with multiple datasets within a city. While the MIT group wasn’t trying to unmask specific users in this dataset, they proved that someone acting in bad faith could merge such anonymized datasets with personal ones using the same process, easily pinning the timestamps together to figure out who was who. So, what is the point of installing the best security systems in your house, if the data collectors are just a click and a few dollars away from knowing everything about you?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The recent wave of individualism has been heralded as a new era for humanity. Every human being is their own self, and they need not conform to societal standards. Data mining, however, is in gross violation of the very essence of individualism. Data mining believes in labelling and profiling populations of the earth, based on race, sex, ethnicity and demographics. In this process, they end up creating generalised data which doesn’t reflect upon the characteristics and uniqueness of the different groups. The outcome of data mining lays the foundation, for a building of towering proportions called discrimination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Data mining gives its wielder, powers to sway events on a global scale. The biggest superpower on the face of the Earth, the United States of America, is not an alien to the effects of these powers. Using data mining techniques and a little help from Facebook, Cambridge Analytica was able to target Americans and influence their choices in the 2016 presidential elections. Over 50 million Americans were nudged and coaxed into thinking that they wanted to vote for a certain candidate. This menace has far reaching implications. Imagine a Jihadi outfit, which wants to radicalise and recruit, any person who is dissatisfied with their government and has a violent streak. Now, think of them purchasing data from such firms. Targeted videos, Facebook &amp; YouTube does the rest of the job for them, constantly feeding violence and dissatisfaction into the brains of their targets and voila! The world has another ISIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were doomed the moment our data and our personal information hit the market and was handed over to a third party to manipulate us, into buying, thinking, doing and speaking just as the party seemed fit. The data generators of today, have become guinea pigs, for just about anyone can afford to hire data scientists and have our data analysed. Imagine a world where there are no secrets, no veil of privacy, where your neighbour knows what kind of movies you watch, or your local grocer knows that you went to Switzerland last month. This is where we are heading, into a world where secrets are taboo, privacy no longer valued and your private data available for a few cents. It is high time that we become conscious and aware of the data we generate, who has access to it and who uses it for what purpose. The late Tony Stark quite rightly said, “You start with something pure. Something exciting. Then come the mistakes, the compromises. We create our own demons.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Illustration By Anirudh Kundu</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Srivats Poddar, Software Engineering, Class of 2020 who secured a placement at Amazon.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Did you continuously prepare during your first 2 years of college, prepared for the interviews exclusively before they happened?</strong></p><p>Having sat down for companies in the internship season without much preparation, I concretely began my preparation in October 2018 (5th Semester), with an online competitive coding course. However, this was merely an initial step. I got more focused during the summer of 2019, i.e., just before the placement season.</p><p><strong>What did you give more priority to - the Profile Offered or the Company Reputation?</strong></p><p>Given the vast variety of job openings, I preferred to first choose a job profile of my liking and then try to aim for highly reputed companies. But given the fact that a majority of the companies that visited our campus offered the Software Development Profile, my choices ultimately boiled down to the companies’ reputation. However, in the future, if possible, even if it is of no benefit to me, I would like to see a wider variety of tech job profiles being offered by the companies visiting the campus.</p><p><strong>How important are referrals in getting placed at big companies?</strong></p><blockquote><p>If <i>Sundar Pichai</i> or <i>Bill Gates</i> were to recommend me for a tech job opening at your firm, wouldn’t you hire me?</p></blockquote><p>Don’t take my word for it, but I think referrals do aid in getting a job. Think of it this way, if <i>Sundar Pichai</i> or <i>Bill Gates</i> were to recommend me for a tech job opening at your firm, wouldn’t you hire me? Referrals are definitely not the only way to get a job, but they just happen to be one of the many ways. I had no referrals while applying for placements, and I still managed to get a placement at Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which is given more emphasis: competitive programming skills or projects?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, competitive programming skills are given more emphasis. It is because the aim of competitive programming is very much in hand with what any company wants from a software developer, i.e. the ability to write a bug-free code, which can solve a given problem efficiently, both in terms of time and computing resources. This doesn’t mean projects are of no value. For companies like Google, that shortlist candidates for personal interviews based on their CVs, having good projects is a big plus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What prerequisites, besides the basic course knowledge, are beneficial for applying to Amazon?</strong></p><p>The ability to solve difficult problems in an environment with limited resources is one prerequisite that is hugely beneficial for applying to Amazon. This is one skill which isn’t exactly taught in the college curriculum, and it can only be acquired by having solved many problems, be it on coding platforms, or in various competitions.</p><p><strong>What are the specific skills that Amazon looks for, which are often neglected by other companies?</strong></p><p>I don’t think Amazon looks for any specific skills that may get neglected by other companies. I think it is just the selection procedure that is very rigorous, so one must have their basics very clear. Considering my interview experience, I had 4 rounds of interviews, wherein I was asked around 4-5 questions in each round, all based on Data Structures and Algorithms, that makes roughly 16-20 questions of writing algorithms.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed KK Verma, a member of Harvard Business Review, who was in DTU as a mentor for the Startup Weekend 19' organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Your journey has been vastly multidimensional considering you have been part of the Air Force, IIT, and now Harvard Business Review. How would you describe your journey?&nbsp;</strong><br>The journey has been really spectacular. Ultimately, the product is me as a thinker and an author, who has authored books on unlearning. We learn things, and I say that you must unlearn your past experiences or habits or traditions so that you can acquire new ones. This idea is not just for writing a look: I did it personally for the last 30 years. People around me were not aware of electronics and computers, and during that time I pursued Electronics Engineering and I could do that because of the habit of unlearning, and because I realised the future is in the favour electronics, even in the 1980s. Subsequently, I joined the Air Force to earn my bread and butter and I wanted to become an officer too. Then I felt that 20 years are good enough and I became an author. By that time I had enough resources and sustainability, and my future was secured, so I took a leap of faith to become an author.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>How has this journey been personally, in terms of any any ups or downs, or places where you felt like you had to compromise in your career?&nbsp;</strong><br>There's is a simple word you could use instead of compromise. Life is brutal. You may feel like you go just down, to hell, but then if you are a person who understands technology and its power, even if you are going through a phase of down, you have the backup of technology, knowledge and wisdom. Every morning I get up and I maintain my schedule and discipline, and I don’t play with my finances much as it is very risky; keeping myself in a safe situation where I can survive even if the toughest thing happens is essential. But <i>downs</i> or <i>ups</i> are always an integral part of life.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>You have been through the Engineering phase: You must know the life of 8 AM lectures and completing the assignments at the last moment which is plainly because of the lack of discipline in our lives. We have issues with discipline and you having worked in careers that require great work ethic, how do you recommend we work on it?&nbsp;</strong><br>Personally, I feel that we have an advantage over any other profession because we have the power of technology and technology is an integral part of growth. In the <i>90s</i> and <i>2000s</i> we have seen that engineers can do businesses in millions. Narayan Murthy and Nandan Nilekani are stellar examples. Nandan Nilekani was the originator of Aadhar; he led the groundwork for making the Aadhar Card IDs universal.<br>Engineers have lead from the front in the last decade and in the days to come, engineers will continue to lead. I was an Air Force pilot and I have seen my fair share of politics, but engineers<br>must grow and change their profession, go to the managerial level then further to the supervisor level and even to the mentor level and finally go at the driving level, i.e., when Engineers lead new projects.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>It is often claimed that everything you learn in your 4 years of engineering will become redundant down the line due to new technological advancements. For you to be in touch with this profession, you need to be constantly learning. How true is this statement in the real world today?&nbsp;</strong><br>No, I don’t think that this holds any truth. As someone who has worked closely with the concept of Unlearning and authored 3 books on it, I believe that what we need is to know more than just the basic skills. As engineers, our learning of different things must continue. The focus should not be on merely acquiring knowledge, but more on learning new and varied things that would encourage and enable future growth. It’s completely right to state that things get outdated after a while. Certain statistics predict that 90% of the companies that are functioning currently might vanish in a few years and be replaced by new ones that have overthrown them, simply because they have different and more advanced skills. For students, it thus becomes integral to study and learn new things. Keep unlearning anything that has become redundant and find new sources of information. Anyone who is attached to old methods can’t progress and prosper, for it is only through acquiring new skills that we can keep moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>A current trend amongst engineering students seems to be that of switching careers from something technical to more financially rewarding fields. Why do you think this switch has become so popular?&nbsp;</strong><br>This is how society has always functioned. A normal part of human evolution is to always go for something better, and to constantly improve ourselves. When I did engineering, I thought it was the best thing to do. However, your vision broadens as you discover more beneficial prospects. If I feel that doing an MBA is better, then I would do join an MBA program. If I feel that running a company is even better, then I will switch to entrepreneurship. The only difference in this case would be that my wisdom domain will come into play. One thing we must keep in mind is awareness about our ‘wisdom domains’, so that the knowledge we acquire does not go to waste.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>How has the journey been as a member of Harvard Business Review, one of the most established business review columns?&nbsp;</strong><br>In 2005, when I left the Indian Air Force, there was one institution called, Indian Society for Training and Development, which called me and offered me to become a faculty there. I wish that more and more Indian Institutions followed this uncommon trend. However, HBR, having noted my presence online, invited me to become a member. They noticed me largely because of my articles, present on my blog. In India, this approach is hardly followed. Due to this, a large pool of Indian talent is not valued. Talking about HBR, it has been a great journey. I am responsible for choosing topics and the mode of operation, all over the world.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why do fields like Environment, Finance, etc., get more funding from economic institutions like the World Bank, as compared to core engineering fields?&nbsp;</strong><br>I believe this is due to a global phenomenon, over which we have no control. Hence, I advise engineers not to get affected by it. If your heart is in a field and you can imagine yourself enjoying after being 15-20 years in that field, then you should definitely pursue it. My advice to today’s engineers is, to have a well-settled life, for at least 10 or 20 years. While doing so, enjoy the other aspects of life. Do not try to build your life in a day or two. Make a long-term plan and find the right advisors. If we follow this approach, then I am sure one will have a successful life.</p>",

Most students are reluctant to go to school but at the same time, love to go to be with their friends. As we go on to higher classes, our hatred converts to love as the sand-like time flies off our hands signifying our inevitable departure from school.</p><p>We all enter the school crying and wailing, pleading our parents not to send us to there and now we regret passing our twelfth grade. School's protective environment breaks open as soon as we leave the board exam hall.</p><p>Taking a trip down memory lane, we come across many hilarious instances and unforgettable memories that we were a part of during our journey in school.They may serve as amusing anecdotes for our children but most importantly they serve us with something which when reminisced never fails to bring a smile on our faces. We may not be able to recall everything that the books or the notes the teachers dictated to us ever taught us , but we won't be able to forget the once-in-a-lifetime experience of being a school kid.</p><p>Some of the memories which make us miss school more than ever include, savouring dishes from our friends' tiffins while neglecting our own to suffer our mom's wrath, howls, hoots and screams from the back benchers at inappropriate times always made even the most boring lectures fun, sleeping over the desks while pretending to read a book while your faithful friend sitting ahead of you conceals you completely from the teacher's view, copying each other's homework at the last minute was one of our daily tasks, and of course commanding respect and bossing around while flaunting the 'School Prefect' Badge has to be the winner, and the benches, tables, dusters, pens and chalks which were once the weapons of classroom battles, now are remembered as old friends.</p><p>The innumerable silent chuckles and giggles during the biology classes, all made its way to the list of the indelible memories. The rare announcements&nbsp; of the teacher being absent and that of a free period used to make our day and the series of comical names we had for our friends was never ending.&nbsp;</p><p>But then again, there is a lingering ever-growing feeling of sadness of&nbsp;being out of school as the chasm of safety in which we were cocooned along with our friends, for twelve long years, has ceased to exist. We left many things behind, which are still trapped in the walls of our classrooms, but we took with us a lot more in both quantity and quality, knowledge in abundance, plentiful of memories, never-to-be-forgotten friendships and a lot more. The lessons of books as well as those of life which the teachers imparted to us, need to be remembered at all stages of our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>We came in as&nbsp; innocent, gullible, obsequious and ignorant students, but we left school as independent, smart, confident social beings of the world.</p>",

Read on as Gehna Sharma, 3rd year, BA (H) Economics, analyses the Indian economy during the festive season.</strong></i></p><p>The festive season is everyone’s favourite. Some like it for the celebrations while some just drool over the holidays that come in this season! The businessmen and retailers have a different reason to fall for the festive season though – it’s this season that brings home about a quarter of their annual revenue. The festivities commence with Onam celebrations and continue till Diwali. Navratri, Durga Pooja, and Dussehra along with some Jain and Sikh holidays are a few other festivals celebrated during this time period.</p><p>The celebrations around this time of the year call for extravagance, shopping sprees, and retail therapy. Besides, custom requires the majority of us to spend considerable fractions of our savings on making long-awaited purchases of assets, jewelry, cars or even real estate. We probably believe too much in the pleas for prosperity that we make to Goddess Lakshmi, as we let cash flow effortlessly through our pockets during the Diwali season without worrying much about savings.</p><p>But then there are also some of us, for whom the last-minute shopping and trips to the neighborhood market seem like a never-ending ordeal as guests start taking over our abode and long-lost relatives show up at odd hours of the day!</p><p>While the festive season sales’ contribution to the national output is not to be undermined, it is still left for us to decipher how this festive season, in particular, will shape the growth figures of the Indian economy.&nbsp;</p><p>Going by a recent Economic Times report, consumption picked up in the first weekend of this particular festive season with net sales in the fashion and apparel, smartphone and consumer electronics categories snowballing at a great pace.</p><p>While this may seem like good news, the truth is that short term spurts in demand attributable to the festivities merely help in improving the short-term consumption demand and a slew of long-term reforms are needed overall. The government’s inability to do something concrete to improve the overall consumer demand is partly responsible for a slowdown which will continue well into the festival season.</p><p>The common man, small and medium scale enterprises have all been hit hard by the negative sentiment spread across the economy currently, with the current unemployment levels only adding up to it. Even as students we have all felt this crippling fear as the uncertainty surrounding the job market grows and there is no guarantee of securing decent placements even with the best of grades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although the conundrum our economy finds itself in paved the way for sellers like Amazon, Flipkart to offer massive discounts and to come up with a combination of easy payment schemes specially designed keeping in mind the festivities to lure us into buying - we still have a long and treacherous way to go before we can reinforce the projected growth figures of seven or eight percent as the economic slowdown continues.</p><p>All in all, the picture of India’s economic growth may seem bleak when focused on. The economy is yet to witness the dramatic upsurge in its operations that will heave it out of the clutches of the worst slowdown that it has witnessed in the last six years.</p><p>Meanwhile, I guess it’s time for me to get back to cleaning my room for the annual Diwali cleaning bonanza with the hopes that this festive season, it’s not just rockets shooting up but our economy too!</p>",

Read on as how N.Krithika, 1st year, ENE elaborates on the beginning of a new chapter 'The college-hood'.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Illustration Credits: Tejasv Mohan</strong></p><p>Entering college is a whole new experience in itself. It feels like a big roller coaster ride, packed with a plethora of emotions, nervousness, excitement, happiness, all at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>You feel like <i>Alice</i> entering your own <i>Wonderland</i>, a land full of opportunities; opportunities to be explored, opportunities waiting for you to grab them. College life is the beginning of a new journey, one to be celebrated with fervour and fanfare. A journey filled with fun and frolic which seems no less than a festival. A journey where one comes across new people and makes new friends.</p><p>Just like how you prepare for any other festivity, you also prepare for college; you buy new clothes, shoes, cell phone and other necessities showcasing your identity. You celebrate your own individuality, broaden your horizons, unleash your creativity and discover a new meaning to life. For you, every single day is a party. Be it the scrumptious <i>paneer dosa</i> or the gratifying <i>masala maggi</i> or the <i>honey chilli potato</i> dripping with sauce at the canteen (hyperbolic expression for all the food critics out there), you really enjoy your meals. And that, as is evident, is not because of the taste, but because whatever the taste of the food may be, your friends - who suddenly transform into Galactus when it comes to you offering a treat - give you company. Obviously, the food is no parallel to <i>ghar ka khaana.</i></p><p>The academics, of course, never let you free because the <i>syllabus</i>, no matter how hard you try, will never be completed. But college is the place where you suddenly become young <i>Hanuman</i>, discovering your hidden talents and superpowers. Given your realization, you manage everything, from academics, to societies, to projects and to fests!</p><p>That reminds me of these extravagant celebrations of our <i>being</i>: Fests. They are, no doubt, one of the most colourful and exuberant parts of college life, from staying in your friend's hostel to dressing your best for the events and swaying to the tunes of your favourite band. Everything seconds amidst the highly pulsating crowd and the energy of high wattage performances.</p><p>All these memories, when someday you will look back on your Instagram, Snapchat stories and&nbsp;Boomerangs, will make you reminisce teary-eyed the moments and the celebration, the festival which every person enjoyed to the fullest - College life!</p>",

And if one were to have the misfortune of pulling off such an antic upon the successful completion of an Engineering degree, very much a holy grail till the turn of the previous decade, chances are high that he would weigh heavily the possibility of becoming a recluse on account of intense lambasting and condemnation that he would be subjected to. In societal terms, one were to be considered successful broadly only if he pursued a degree in the sciences or engineering and procured a highly remunerative job. The only permissible destination where the individual could take his business to thence was a Business school. Times have changed since. While this has been the norm for a very long time, things seem to have taken a turn for the better.</p><p>Ever since cultural events at engineering colleges have come to be a rage and cultural societies have gained significant traction, a mad scramble has set in to identify potential candidates with a strong inclination towards the areas of dances, music and their likes. To this end, there appears to have been a paradigm shift compared to the yesteryears where the centre of attention had not gravitated substantially towards enhancing one’s prowess in non-academic avenues, especially those artistic, in stark contrast to the present circumstances.</p><p>For long, there has also been a tangible dearth of sportsmen hailing from engineering backgrounds. With the turn of the century, however, inter-collegiate sporting events have not only invigorated the sporting landscape but have also provided a massive impetus to numerous sports-persons to enroll themselves into said institutions furnishing them with a professional degree as an added advantage.</p><p>A little guidance and prodding from one's peers and superiors cements his belief in his flair in the arts or his physical acumen and allows him to transcend the imaginary boundaries situated between the world of arts, sports and engineering and carve a career thereupon. This phenomenon leads to spectacles which were rather unforeseen hitherto allowing the conception of genius in the corresponding areas of expertise. It would be foolish to neglect, thus, the fact that the current generation is purportedly adept at casting aside their fears stemming from antipathetic societal perception of disciplines considered ‘non-academic’ primarily due to the successes of such engineers in their respective fields.</p><p>While the world is replete with engineers who found their calling in arts and sports and shone in such areas, it would be blasphemous to downplay the exploits of other engineers in literary and scientific avenues. With the advent of modern technology, not only has the bar been lifted for engineers to pursue higher-paying jobs, a rather unintentional outcome of the aforementioned proceeding has been the exposure to freedoms in pursuing interests in unconventional areas which, while falling within the gamut of sciences and engineering, were limited due to either lack of resources or opportunities in the home country. Consequently, there has been a tremendous boom in engineers taking cognizance of possible careers in alternative science and engineering lines of research proving their mettle thereupon.</p><p>Hence, with the dissipation of the myth that a degree in Engineering sets you up for life, there has been an enormous efflux of engineers into other professions, thus allowing one to choose a job that he wants and not the one that is picked for him by the likes of certain well-wishers. With the population ballooning, it becomes almost unavoidable that the chunk of those who take up engineering would also swell. Yet, what remains indisputable is the fact that engineers will continue to venture into uncharted territories, setting whopping benchmarks along the way, and further enriching the connotation associated with the label of ‘engineer’.</p>",

Their business and management acumen would prove beneficial for the event, along with the fact that they will be communicating with people from all other streams of DTU and will be getting a chance to enhance their skills.&nbsp;<br>As far as PhD and M.Tech. students are concerned, their participation and involvement in technical societies will bring a lot of expertise of Research &amp;Development in their respective fields and will also give them a chance to explore their areas of interest. We need to realize both our technical and management potential of the University and bring all of them together, involving people from all streams to guide each other. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What steps is the SA panning to take to increase the participation of the female students in the proceedings in the university?</strong></p><p>Just like all major universities, we are planning to create a Women Development Cell, a division of DTU-SA, which will be fully focused on their development and making sure that every girl is given a chance to participate in all functions and events of the college.</p><p><strong>What techniques and skills are required in organising and managing an entire event successfully with minimal flaws?</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Every event is successful only when each member works in full collaboration with each other. All our events have specific teams handling every sphere of the event like PR, Corporate, Hospitality etc., each having people with the relevant skills. All of them work together to organize and manage everything perfectly. Team work, proper planning and coordination are very necessary to carry out an event with minimal flaws.</p><p><strong>When did you think that you were capable of handling a position of such great power and responsibility in the university?</strong></p><p>\"Being at the apex of various student bodies in my third year, I felt that there was a huge difference in the expectations of the students versus what was actually happening. So, after much deliberation, I thought I could be a suitable candidate for DTU-SA and bring this much-needed change, and hence decided to contest for the same.\" - Pulkit.</p><p><strong>Since a majority of the population in DTU is of day scholars, what events has the SA planned this year specifically for them?</strong></p><p>This year we will plan to conduct Arena, the inter-branch sports tournament, in a better way including cash prizes and trophies so that the participants feel more involved. Moreover, most of the events held, like literary fest, sports fest, technical fest etc. are during the day time only. We will try to ensure better participation of the day scholars this year.&nbsp;<br>Along with this, we would like every student to use every facility of the college like indoor sports hall, reading room, etc. by regularly informing them about the same. We want to focus on hostelers and day scholars together, and not individually.</p><p><strong>How to plan to bridge the communication gap between the students and the SA?</strong></p><p>It is really important to have effective communication between our team and the students of the college. For the same, we have decided to come up with an online platform through which everyone can send their queries and report their problems. Our team will try to solve each of them. In addition to this, we will be appointing our volunteers in every year and every stream, so that no matter what and even in our absence every problem can be heard.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Uday Sai, 2nd year, BBA tries to capture the eventful journey of a student at USME-DTU</strong></i></p><p>The pedagogy at USME is designed to surprise just when you think you are getting the hang of things. In simpler terms, we follow a case-based pedagogy which essentially means that there is very little taught in terms of theoretical knowledge and almost every subject stresses on application. We have case studies for every subject and session, where we analyse a certain situation faced by a company and come up with our solutions for the issues faced.</p><p>Beside the application-based teaching approach, the real superstars of USME-DTU are the young professors. Some lectures are 60-75 minute session of theatrics, complete with captivating narrations, expressions and emotions. Some of our teachers just nonchalantly dismiss the banal things, such as the country’s fiscal policy or certain world views you might hold dearly; others are supposed to teach you about law, but end up giving valuable life lessons through a discourse on philosophy. Some even make you understand a concept with “Kabir Das ke dohe” and their hilarious English translations, while some professors make you observe the impracticality of your solutions, which turns out to be a testament to your inexperience and how much of the world you are yet to experience.</p><p>The amazing moments with the faculty often stand out. The list is quite long and includes many instances such as when every student was well-dressed at a professor’s last session to fulfill his lifelong wish of seeing a room full of well-dressed students, or when a professor conducted a simulated game of Kaun Banega Crorepati to test the class’ understanding of the concepts learnt, and maybe when a professor gave an emotional narration of how he had to change his teaching style to keep up with the changing times.</p><p>There are students from unique backgrounds and varying personalities to be found inside our campus. The best part of my class is the discussion between me, a science background student, and my peers coming from a commerce background. In a class of sixty odd people, you often get a wide variety of views. You might agree with some of them but the clash of the detractors is a great spectacle that often plays out in class.</p><p>USME-DTU also teaches you punctuality. A 9:00 AM class means you have to be in the class by 8:45. Class participation points are closely monitored and the students make sure you do not get away with putting up random points in front of the professor. The students are allotted to study-groups at the beginning of the academic year and all the group assignments and presentations are done within the group. Some of your group members become your best friends and there will be a lot of cases when you cover for your friend in a group project.</p><p><i>Thankfully, the students, faculty and administration make sure the experience is all worth it.</i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Phil McKoy, CIO, UnitedHealthcare, who was in DTU for a Leadership Session organized by the Training &amp; Placement Department, DTU, in association with Optum Engage.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What motivated you to venture into technology after getting degrees in Political Science and International Affairs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When I was in school, I had no intention of pursuing a career in technology. I wanted to work internationally. I grew up in Jamaica and had a passion for the world and its different cultures. During my Master’s degree, I specialized in International Economics, which was consistent with what I wanted to do in life. To work internationally, I could have joined one of the big firms, but that meant waiting until I was middle-management to get the prolonged expat opportunities I was seeking. Being considerably impatient, I went into consulting, because that is a profession that takes you wherever the work is. I joined a consulting firm, and there I was first exposed to technology. I started coding in C++, writing financial reports through codes, and so consulting became my window to both technology as well as to start working internationally.</p><p><strong>What key differences have you felt between the Indian engineers and those in other parts of the world?</strong></p><p>There is a term that I have been introduced to during my time in India. It’s ‘<i>Jugaad</i>’. There is a notion of innovation that comes out of necessity in every Indian. The ability to find creative solutions amid a world of ambiguity, irrespective of the path or the surrounding ecosystem, is a trademark of the Indian culture. A sense of figuring it out and the ability to ‘<i>jugaad</i>’ a solution is what sets an Indian engineer apart. There are creative engineers all around the world, but there is something about Indians that enables them to create so much from so little. Despite the hurdles, be it the lack of infrastructure or fewer tools, there exists a profound sense of creativity, innovation and the ability and capability to find a solution in all situations. That is a particularly distinguishable trait that I have seen in all Indian engineers that I have worked with in my career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There exists a significant gap between academic coursework and industry demands. How can students, in their personal capacity, bridge this gap?</strong></p><blockquote><p>In order to be a good working professional, you need to be aware of the changes happening around you.</p></blockquote><p>I think one of the gaps is exposure and understanding of real-world experiences. As you go through university, you undergo structured learning and have a structured process where you come out with deep technical knowledge. But opportunities always exist for both the students and the university to get acquainted with more real-world problems. It is important to read more than just the available technical material and to inherently understand trends both in your country and around the globe. When it comes to healthcare, one has unique opportunities here in India. Healthcare is reinventing itself, and there are many challenges to be dealt with, be it the chronic rise in population, diabetes crisis or the rural &amp; urban divide. In order to be a good working professional, you need to be aware of the changes happening around you. This is something you have to seek out, understand, read and participate in. Experiencing the situations personally, seeing what works and what doesn’t, and then working upon improving the technology and combating the inefficiencies in the sector is crucial for growth.</p><p><strong>One of the major plagues of the healthcare industry is the cost of the services. How does UHG plan to make healthcare services affordable in developing Asian countries?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>At UHG, we regularly employ AI and Machine Learning to the data to understand any underlying patterns which would allow us to look for treatments ahead of time.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>One of the ways to control cost is by intervening long before diseases become acute. For people with chronic conditions, one can look into the longitudinal data, gather a sense of what is happening beforehand, and then come up with treatment policies that would allow us to counter chronic diseases. Lately, technology has a role to play in the daily management of health conditions, whether it is medication, alternative treatments or keeping track of the symptoms. Thus, by syncing technology, healthcare becomes more affordable and advanced.&nbsp;</p>",

We attempt to apply the knowledge of our subjects to all initiatives here at USME. We witnessed the work done by our seniors and faculty members first-hand and aim to use our learnings. Despite having limitations, we give our best and the overwhelming responses of the students upon putting together a good event always remain our biggest motivation.</p><p><strong>How is the council able to overcome the various hurdles faced while organising events successfully?</strong></p><p>Barriers and blockades are inevitable but they shouldn’t stop us from moving forward. We try to work our way around them and achieve our set targets. The paucity of funds is one of the most prominent barriers we face when organising any event. With the help of corporate contacts and a dedicated Fund Raising Cell, we manage to bag sponsorships and scale our events.</p><p><strong>What are some important factors to consider before putting together a good event and how do you measure its success?</strong></p><p>1. Planning</p><p>Organising a successful event requires rigorous hours of planning and meticulous plotting of every aspect of the event, right from getting sponsorships and job distribution, to timing every activity till the last minute. We plan all the logistics and the promotion work of the events.</p><p>2. Drafting Budget</p><p>We draft our budget after extensive market research whilst we check for any unforeseeable situation and accounting for miscellaneous overhead expenses too at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3. Allocating Responsibilities</p><p>We distribute tasks among all the team members not only during the preparation stage but also at the time of the event so that we know who to contact for any specific issue. We also have faculty advisors to help us through thick and thin.</p><p>4. Promotions</p><p>With a concrete plan and a dedicated team, we target our audience well and ensure that our ideas are accurately conveyed and use the help of posters, class-to-class promotions and well drafted messages to reach out.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Measuring Success</p><p>The smiles on the faces of all the attendees gives us the feedback that the event was a success. After the post-production evaluations and cost analysis, we measure the efficiency in the planning and execution of every event.</p><p><strong>How do you intend to change the academics-oriented mindset of the students and encourage their participation in extracurricular activities?</strong></p><p>It’s important to get good grades, but it is equally important to develop interpersonal skills. Extracurricular activities allow students to relax and identify new hobbies, and it will certainly aid students a lot in their professional life. Our university promotes participation in these activities and encourages students to learn from their experience. All in all, the pursuit of these activities will certainly lead to a fulfilling academic experience.</p><p><strong>What should be expected of the cultural council this year concerning the annual fest - Traction?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Cultural Council is set to organise the fest at an even bigger scale. We have already started working upon the shortcomings of the previous years. We are looking forward to securing more sponsorships this academic year, and have started working on inviting the star performers to the fest. The Cultural Council is determined to make the annual fest attain new heights.</p>",

Assigning individual roles to all the members creates a system of accountability and also preventing tasks from falling to the wayside.</p><p>An event usually involves:</p><ul><li>Making an action plan</li><li>Drafting a budget taking into account unforeseeable situations</li><li>Getting permission and securing the venue</li><li>Publicising the event and spreading the word amongst the target audience</li></ul><p>It is extremely important to have some way of gauging event success to improvise and make sure that the next one is even better. We believe that the success of any event is directly proportional to the crowd that shows up. Personal feedback is another way. Also, it's not just the attendees’ level of satisfaction that determines event success, but also that of the sponsors because they are the backbone of the event.</p><p><strong>What is the team’s vision for the current academic session to boost the cultural spirit in the campus?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>We yearn to put together the best fest that DTU has ever seen!</p></blockquote><p>We aim to organise as many cultural events as possible to keep the enthusiasm and zeal alive amongst the students throughout the year. The&nbsp;<strong>Freshers’ Week</strong>, organised in September, and&nbsp;<strong>Dandiya Night</strong>, organised in October, went quite smoothly and were individual successes. For now, we are exceedingly focused on Engifest 2020 as we yearn to put together the best fest that DTU has ever seen. At the same time, we are committed to organising various kinds of informal events preceding Engifest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the setbacks or implementation failures that you have faced and how do you plan to get past them?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We all learn and grow from our mistakes and take the necessary measures to avoid them in the future. We always try to keep a back-up plan in case of any unforeseeable situations. For example, if we have to immediately change the location of the event due to any unavoidable reason, even the smallest of the detail needs to be taken care of. The benefit of having a great team is that you’ll not have to remember every single detail or do every little task by yourself. Checking the location and all the equipments before the event is extremely necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are your views about the work of various cultural societies in DTU and how can they be encouraged?</strong></p><p>DTU is home to multifarious cultural societies which fuel the hidden talents in individuals and help them in becoming a better version of themselves by positively channeling their creativity. At the same time, these instill core values such as teamwork, leadership skills and dedication which sets the individuals apart from everyone around. We believe that these societies help in boosting the confidence of every individual and play a very important role in developing the personality of the students while teaching them how to have fun! Through the years, all the societies have done an amazing job and gained recognition wherever they have performed or even won. They’ve only added to the glory of DTU.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How would you justify the lack of representation of diversity in the Cultural Council? How does the present Cultural Council ensure that everybody's needs are looked after?</strong></p><p>As far as diversity from the various branches is considered, people from any branch are allowed to apply for posts in the Cultural Council. One seat is reserved for female candidates to enable a fair representation.</p><p>The Cultural Council works to improve the cultural atmosphere of the university and works for all the students and not just a few people, hence, everything that needs to be done for improving fests and cultural events shall be taken into consideration given that it aligns with the ambit of the Cultural Council.</p><p><strong>How do you intend to change the academics-oriented mindset of the students and encourage their participation in extracurricular activities?</strong></p><p>Soft skills get little respect from some students, but it can be a catalyst to one's growth, not limited to their careers. Good communication skills also give you an edge in the various interviews and sets you apart from the other candidates. If we look at the work culture from a decade ago, employees showed very little participation in the generation of new ideas and just focused on their daily tasks. Today, along with your job description, you are also required to analyse and solve different problems, create new ways to do traditional tasks more effectively and efficiently, and prove to be a valuable asset to the company. Extracurricular activities equip an individual for the various hurdles that they might face in their professional life.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Ishaan Gupta, 2nd year, ME takes a dive into the meme culture and our newest means of social interaction.</strong></i></p><p><i>If you’ve not seen a meme about it, it’s probably not important enough.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Be it our shared idiosyncrasies or our takes on the latest socio-political issues. Memes are the ultimate example of how we, as millennial and Gen-Z kids, like our content.&nbsp;</p><p>Memes are slowly becoming our go-to method of consuming content and social interaction. As we get more nihilistic and spend more time with our phones than a book in metro rides, we’re weaving a story of our generation. A phenomenon we refuse to talk about.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Is inaction breeding a bigger audience for memes?</i></p><p>Memes and trolls about depression are so deeply prevalent in our lives that the line between romanticisation and <i>hyper-awareness </i>blurs everyday. The quality of being extremely aware about our situation is worrying, to say the least. We take comfort in our introspective superiority and refuse to do something to <i>actually </i>improve our situation. Our situation’s repercussions do not scare us as much as they should. Rather, we capitalise on our mental illnesses to seek bonding, to socially validate ourselves. We do that because, well, i<i>t works like a charm. </i>A portrayal of mental health issues through humour is a coping mechanism that <i>pays </i>in popularity and appreciation of wit. Our culture enables the condition of mental illness by romanticizing it and putting an incentive on its head. In a scenario like this, we'd be stupid to not do it? Maybe?</p><p>Maybe, <i>shitposting</i> is the only organic answer to the other side of social media.&nbsp;</p><p>While half our feeds is hell bent on showing us curated lives of our happy friends, depression memes are a complete opposite of the positivity that used to be social media’s USP. The friend who makes an anniversary post about his parents is the same friend who double taps on a meme about Freud’s infamous Oedipus complex. As we’re taught about the grayness of our lives, social media shows a demarcation of humanity. It shows that a person can be black-and-white instead of gray; that your need to express contempt and hope for something else can exist together, yet stay immiscible. At the end of the day, both of them are a means to the same end: an end of instant gratification.</p><p>Self-contradiction is an art we’re getting too effortless at. We go on about our tendencies of social isolation and how much we like it; all of it to get replies, comments and anything that makes our thoughts feel relevant enough in this myriad of people trying to seek approval. It is becoming a form of suffering we long for. Our memes tell a tale of our confusion. Our memes are a cry for help and yet, a resignation into the abyss of its nihilism. It brings us&nbsp; to our next question,&nbsp;</p><p>Are we jealous of the people who are <i>actually </i>happy with their lives? And if so, would we give up our relatability in exchange? Do we want to be happy or relatable?</p><p>The culture that memes breed brings up several equally important questions. One of them being, as we garner a larger community and nurture it with our deepest flaws, are we taking&nbsp;a lesson that we’re not alone anymore or are all of us really being lonely together?</p>",

The nurture of family and loved ones, the childhood memories, friends, neighbours all instil a sense of reminiscence. When you're living away from home, this feeling increases multi-fold.</p><p>Every festival, long weekend is associated with a reminiscent feeling of home. <i>I'll get to go home.</i> Every tiring week, busy work schedule, exhausting travel is followed by this ever-relaxing feeling of going home. Personally, I feel it's the best detox one can have from the toxic daily routine life.</p><p>Staying away from home makes you appreciate it even more; not just for the comforts and nurture of the parents, but also the lessons that you learn. Till about 18 years of living, all the daily chores were taken care of. When you live on your own, you actually have to perform these chores. Even worse, learn how to perform first. The list of things you have to do, half of which you never knew needed attention, is endless.&nbsp;</p><p>Home always reminds you of the days of playing outside with friends, hours of naïve cricket, getting dirty in the mud, dancing in the rain. It is a memoir of your lost childhood. It’s the place where you relished grandma's bedtime stories every night. All the memories of home are of the time when technology didn’t take over. You fell asleep gazing at the glow-in-the-dark stars on your ceiling, rather than a PuBG game. You used to cry over a broken toy and not a <i>broken heart</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The busy work-life pushes you away from the carefree days. You get so engrossed in your daily schedule that you seldom think about those days. Once in a while, a Facebook memory or Google Photos memory would show you some old image and you would take that trip down the memory lane for a moment. So why not actually take that trip? Take a break from your ever-engaging life and go for a vacation. Don’t visit some fancy tourist spot or <i>something closer to nature</i>, but visit your home. Spend an afternoon in the courtyard like you used to back then, or see the places you used to go during school days. The flashback that will follow would just be priceless and would be the best break from monotonous routine that you can ask for.</p><p>Instead of tripping over a Facebook memory of <i>This Day 8 Years Ago</i>, do actually recreate that memory and live your childhood back.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Illustration credits: Akshansh Aggarwal</strong></i></p><p>I'm sure every Indian is proud to identify as one. Wait, no. Sadly, there'll be protests to that statement, what with the multiple rape cases that go unreported and unresolved, or the lynching, or the other not-so-secular activities that our constitutionally secular nation harbours.</p><p>I'm an Indian, and despite all of that, I am proud to identify as one. Being Indian is a huge part of my identity. But simply calling myself Indian is still talking about its culture in a very broad sense, since India itself comprises of so many intertwined cultures. India comprises 28 states and 9 union territories now, where the borders contain people following a myriad of belief systems, speaking different dialects, eating a variety of foods and wearing different types of clothes.</p><blockquote><p>As the author M.F. Moonzajer said, \"O<i>ne's culture stands for one's personality and identity. It distinguishes a person from the rest spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Our culture forms the basis of our belief system and ideologies. It is an integral part of who we are. At the time of an ice-breaking introduction, there are several egoistic details that are desirable to include, such as name, designation, and origin, but how useful is this information when the other person has no idea about the place that was just mentioned? For example - \"Hi, I'm Pratiksha Pradhan. I'm a student at Delhi Technological University. I'm from Odisha.\"&nbsp;</p><p><i>\"Um, Odisha? That's a place?\"</i></p><p>Back in the third grade, at a new school, a classmate asked me where I was from. I didn't think twice before I said Odisha, because back then I was too innocent to believe that a level of ignorance existed among us. She gave me the strangest look, and replied, \"Listen, stop trying to fool me, okay? It's not cool, you're not cool. You can't just make up places. By the way, that sounds like the name of a disease.\"&nbsp;</p><p>As she was just a haughty 8-year old, maybe she could be excused. But Indian adults? General knowledge is not so <i>general</i> anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Another friend of mine thought Odisha wasn't even in India. When I explained to her its eastern location neighbouring West Bengal and Bihar and banking Bay of Bengal, the disappointment on her face was unforgettable. After all, I had just shattered her hopes of being her first foreigner friend!&nbsp;</p><p>There are 2 kinds of people I've encountered while telling them where I am from:</p><ol><li>People who know exactly where Odisha is located and love cracking jokes about it.</li><li>People who have no idea where Odisha is located.</li></ol><p>Like with any other place, some preconceived notions regarding Odisha and its people circulate, infamously featured on <i>WhatsApp News</i>. In the presence of my friends and companions, if someone has an Odisha-related query, they deem it imperative to add their comments with much insensitivity. \"You know that state in India that's always in the news when there's a flood or a cyclone?\"</p><p>Once another schoolmate asked me where I was from, so I instinctively answered, \"I am from Odisha.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" he asked, \"You're too beautiful to be from that state.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Conflict and dilemma soon tarnished my thinking - had I just been subjected to a compliment or an insult? Much small talk later, he admitted to thinking that only tribes lived in the Land of Temples and that we hadn’t developed past the medieval stage.</p><p>Odisha is a beautiful place with much historical significance attached to it. It boasts the beauty of the breathtaking architecture of the Konarak Sun Temple, as well as the spirituality of the Jagannath Temple. It's the land where the tyrant Ashoka gave up his weapons and adopted the teachings of Buddha to transform into Ashoka the Great. It may be a very low-profile type of state indeed, but there's so much more to this land than just cyclones and floods. It is an integral part of my identity, my cultural background, and who I am. That's why every time someone asks me, \"Where are you from?\" I don't shy away from explaining to them where I am from, despite having to clarify any unbelievably annoying myths about the place they might believe in. So, once again, I will introduce myself - hi, I'm Pratiksha Pradhan. And I am from Odisha.</p><p><i><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>The views expressed in this article belong solely to the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of DTU Times or Delhi Technological University.&nbsp;</i></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Rujhan Singla, Information Technology, Class of 2020, shares his experience of interning at Samsung R&amp;D, Bangalore (SRI-B) through an on-campus opportunity.</strong></p><p>It all started in July 2018 when different companies started visiting our campus to offer internships. Samsung R&amp;D, Bangalore (SRIB) was the third company to visit and the first one I’d applied for. The recruitment process was reasonably simple: <i>an online coding test, a written coding round and two Technical interviews or one GD and one PI</i>. A total of 28 students got selected from DTU to work there as Summer Interns at Samsung’s Research Centre in Bangalore.</p><blockquote><p>I was very happy as I believe that a corporate intern is really necessary to get a hands-on experience of how things work. In the real world, you need to get your hands dirty to gain exposure and to acquaint yourself with the technical aspect!</p></blockquote><p>While theoretical knowledge is fairly important, the pressure at a corporate company is higher and the deadlines are more rigid as compared to an academic project or course and thus the responsibility and accountability is higher too. At this pivotal stage of our careers, I believe that the most important thing is to keep learning and growing.</p><p><strong>Initial Week&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y7QAPIRbU3t1kxs6gOeBv8gxmnbGeewZjFB6euGdw08x4ubgZiZ-0Ssn1y_tFeC-E_E93pH1rrbbWhp3RMK1yl88tgGq9Y14tBLa5AIJAXQPbK77oSHyduIxk3lu0WrysYiurDGY\"></figure><p>Fast forward a year and it was time to leave for Bangalore. I was a little nervous at first but I only had one thing on my mind: to give my best and keep learning as much as possible in the process. They had arranged 5-star accommodation for us initially and it felt more like a vacation. The week was equipped with frequent Billiards sessions, FIFA sessions and a DJ night. We also used that time for PG-hunting which really showed us a bad side of Bangalore which can be really daunting. You’ll definitely miss your home-made/hostel food. From the first day itself, we all felt very comfortable and welcomed in SRI-B. All of our seniors were very supportive and informal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Induction Program</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eMqdTi1ahFtJuNIM8Pa7af-vzhnnTMzy8geZJ_-mvH3CvLfbbB0DvsWTUhkFcisn29MbN0wXVJu8L66pkFddHrN_GR2Ep9wt-MQSucJOhFpRdaOq2L_z5NGRKUAOvpNnaS-y0BiK\"></figure><p>In the hotel, there was an induction program where we were told about the teams we were allotted and the <i>dos</i> and <i>don’ts</i> of corporate culture. There was an informal interaction in the beginning which I believe was a great way to break the ice between everyone.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We were also told that the interns at SRIB are called <strong>MAGPIES </strong>– <i><strong>M</strong>eticulous, <strong>A</strong>gile, <strong>G</strong>o-Getter, <strong>P</strong>assionate, <strong>I</strong>nnovative </i>and<i> <strong>E</strong>nterprising.</i></p></blockquote><p><strong>The Work</strong></p><p>Each intern was assigned a Mentor and a Manager. There were many teams like <i>IoT, On-device, Networks, Voice Intelligence, Visual Intelligence</i> etc. I was in the Voice Intelligence team and worked on Samsung’s voice assistant, <strong>BixBy</strong>. My task was to enable BixBy to distinguish recorded-replayed (non-authentic) human sounds/ utterances from genuine ones, thus safeguarding devices against potential attacks and malicious and unauthorised access. I wasn’t sure if I would be successful but seeing positive results and after successfully presenting it to the Voice Intelligence team, weeks of hard work and struggle was converted into one emotion – <i><strong>Happiness</strong></i>. Although it depends on your team and mentor but I found my project to be really interesting and something which would helped the company in the long run.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-i97TxNPSHHshq8r2_LA-_-o0Snns4pk-Q3J4Zp3Xk1R9z-d_cFUgtpsqkiNq03PXYzU-VmOLQM6dVUcbLPzzNMggHt672Sdqr1BCTzGej18PknJyn8zNaFlwCXNEZ_JqSsLLWjL\"></figure><p>The internship period also included a coding assessment and an interview, which they clubbed with our mentor’s feedback to evaluate whether an intern should be given a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO). I cleared the Coding and Interview rounds but didn’t get the PPO.</p><p><strong>The Office Culture</strong>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yRd_egs4uuAJ9oTrPoWa0ww4_Mub6Rvyc4_0KDFu8H7F-fYEmVhdf-Y5N7P1oIvCNSRmFzAutCQu-kWQYxN5k1Z59t_awUD6dIhCKTffM4Qy2Ji8h0Sb1mj2_kb6XkW1LY-UjjV3\"></figure><p>As for the workplace, SRI-B is a great one to start with. The work culture is relaxed and the projects are very interesting. It’s a good place to learn and be a part of something new and innovative.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Although the timings were 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. but it was mainly about maintaining a 9-hour average over a month.</p></blockquote><p>The office was astounding and had a gym, a TT table, couple of Foosball tables, a Jam room, a Trip room for recreation, etc. The Tech Complex (Baghmane Constellation Park) also had a Football field and a Basketball court. There were frequent team lunches and outings to keep it that way. They even organised an Intern’s Day full of dance, music, DJ and stand-up performances for us! We even received a bunch of goodies (a bag, a diary, a pen and a T-shirt).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bangalore and the City Life</strong></p><p>As a city, Bangalore is a good place with amazing weather and a great nightlife. The food and traffic can get irksome but overall it’s a must-visit place, especially Kormangala, Indira Nagar and Church Street.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The whole experience of living and interning at Bangalore gave me a sense of freedom and adulthood which I believe is important to be self-sufficient in future.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Takeaways and Tips&nbsp;</strong></p><p><i>• Get out of your comfort zone:</i> You really need to push yourself beyond your limit and out of your comfort zone for actual value addition. In my opinion, one should keep bettering herself/himself at every possible chance. It will seem impossible at the beginning but even if you don’t ‘succeed’, you learn.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Just do what you think you can’t and you will automatically see yourself doing things which seemed unthinkable and impossible at first.</p></blockquote><p><i>• Don’t be limited to work:</i> I believe that there is more to life than a career. Not only are these internship opportunities and experiences important for career, they are also important for one’s personality development as they give a much-needed exposure to broaden your horizons and for changing your outlook towards things in general. Keep working but try not to miss out on other fun stuff.</p><p>Try not to lose touch with anything (other than work) which gives you happiness. Sometimes no matter what you do, it just doesn’t work out in your favour. But, it’s okay and if you have worked hard, one day you’ll get what you deserve. Good luck!&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Param Chhura, Mechanical Engineering with specialisation in Automotive Engineering (MAM), Class of 2020 who secured a placement at Bain Capability Network.</strong></i><br><br><strong>The dilemma of choosing what to pursue plagues quite a few students, as they get confused between a tech profile or a non-tech profile. What advice do you have for them?</strong></p><p>I cannot emphasise enough on how crucial it is to research on both profiles. You should make sure that you completely understand the specific roles in the profiles, and that they are in line with your interests. If you are still confused, I would recommend speaking to your seniors or someone whom you trust. It is completely normal to be confused during the initial stage, therefore, you should not be afraid to ask people for help and to experiment with various fields when determining where your interests lie. How well you excel in the field is completely dependent upon your passion towards the field, your interests, and most importantly, you. If you are going to work hard towards a goal, make sure it is the goal that you yourself have set your eyes on, not the one the crowd is going for.</p><p><strong>How did you get interested in the field of consulting in particular? How did you manage to pursue it while simultaneously focusing on your branch-related academics?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Though I have been interested in the field of consulting for a while now, my interest definitely peaked during my second and third year at the university. Fortunately, two of my friends too, developed similar interests during the same time and before we knew it, we were participating in case study competitions, business quizzes and the likes. This was a great help, since there are certain things that you can learn only when you participate in such events, as opposed to reading about them from a book or through tutorial videos.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Initially, we participated in every case study competition that we could find and eventually went onto establish a university chapter of an international consulting organisation (180 Degrees Consulting), which gave me a chance to work on solutions to real-world problems. Most case study competitions were held over the weekend, which made it easier to juggle participation, and everything else.</p><p><strong>Which resources, that you referred to, helped you the most? What advice would you like to share in regards to preparation?</strong></p><p>One thing that helped me the most was, participating in the various case study competitions across the past year. I would suggest you to sign up for at least one event, if you think that you aren’t ‘qualified’ enough to participate in a case-study competition. You must use it as a means to figure out weak points and then fix them. I strongly believe that you will learn something new in such competitions. In addition to this, I prepared for case-interviews from numerous books, including <i><strong>‘Case Interviews Cracked</strong></i>’, and <i><strong>‘Case in Point’.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p>I practised guesstimates from any resource that I could find, at times even making them up for day-to-day items (such as,<i> ‘What is the daily milk consumption for the apartment building?’</i> and so on.). For tips regarding interviews, I would suggest watching <i><strong>Victor Cheng</strong></i><strong>’s videos on YouTube.</strong> Another tip to maximise the use of the resources would be, to read the problem statement and then attempting to solve it yourself first. You should refer to the solution only after you have tried solving it. This will help you figure out any points that you may have missed, and will come handy in the future.</p><p><strong>How was the selection process for Bain? Any key takeaways that you would want to share?</strong></p><p>First off, there was a CV shortlisting round, following which there was a workshop organised by Bain. They covered multiple tips and strategies on how to approach case-interviews. This was then followed by a written test&nbsp;consisting of MCQs and subsequently, the first round of interview. After the first round of interviews, students were shortlisted and called for a second round of interview, after which the final selection list was announced.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>During the interview, it is very important that you keep your cool and stay confident. Take your time to understand the question, and if at any point of time, you feel that you are going in the wrong direction or you missed out on any point, do not panic. Just hold yourself together, remain composed and retrace your steps. Make sure to explain your steps and ideas to the interviewer clearly. Always remember, communication is the key.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How do you feel engaging in extracurricular activities has helped you in building your profile and consequently, for the interview?</strong></p><p>In today’s world, a balanced profile is something that most companies look for. I think the best way to nurture these skills through extracurricular activities and several competitions. I joined few teams that were diverse in nature, such as <i><strong>180 Degrees Consulting, Enactus, TEDx</strong></i>, and various case-study teams, all of which helped me build upon several different skills as well as gave me information about the important avenues in terms of industry insights, social welfare, operations management and most importantly, problem solving abilities. This came in handy while preparing for the interviews, as most of the teams I was working with, worked on providing real life solutions, helping me develop my own set of frameworks and approaches to problems.</p>",

    "body": "<p>DTU Times interviewed Sunil Solanki, Sr. Director, Head, SAP Cloud Platform, who attended the Startup Weekend as one of the judges.</p><p><strong>There are multiple technologies that have a lot of potential in today's market. Being technical students, what are some technologies that we can tap into?</strong></p><p>If we talk about the list of technologies, the list is endless. It could include anything from Cloud Computing to IoT to AI to RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to something you might not have even heard about. The idea is to figure out which technology to choose, since in today's date students are very confused and whichever technology that a senior follows everyone seems to be following the same path. A few years ago it was Cloud and now it is AI, RPA, etc. One should do a study of top companies in the field of technology and check the product or technology which they focus on currently, this will tell you what is in demand. If you go and see the blogs of Microsoft or SAP, SAP isn't talking about just ERP, they are also talking about RPA (Robotic Process Automation), Cloud Platform, Cloud Analytics, Conversational AI, etc.</p><p>There are some technologies which have not yet matured and there are more advanced technologies coming and hitting us, one has to be prepared to capture these technological shifts.</p><p>Nowadays, if the CEO of a company wants to get immediate data, say the production of one of his plants, he has to wait minimum 4-5 hours while 15-20 individuals all pass the information down the chain of command, whereas with automation, using a few chat bots and data analysis programs, he can simply ask Siri or Alexa and they will get the information in a few seconds. This is the practical reality and what is required, identifying areas which are running the entire supply chain today.</p><p><strong>Nowadays mass recruiting is a common practice among Engineering Colleges, many students prefer to stay in the comfort zone and do not wish to go into these up and coming technologies, due to the risk factor. How can we create an environment for innovation bolstering students to go into these new fields?</strong></p><p>This environment comes from the surrounding support ecosystem. Taking the example of DTU, it is my first visit here, I feel like you have everything. You have industry experts coming and guiding you and you are going to industries. The DTU management and administration is so flexible, I have never heard of an institute that is helping in patenting, research and incubation. These are the important aspects, that make it a highly open environment.</p><p><strong>What are some of the key factors we look for in a successful startup?</strong></p><p>Most people will tell you many criterion for a successful startup. In my opinion, for a country like India, we, as a people, are very efficient as we have our technological strengths and some weaknesses. Considering this, your startup should focus on a couple of things. Firstly, your startup should be impacting a lot of people in the beginning itself, even if it is B2B. Secondly, wherever possible, get a big company as your supporter. We always think to cut down on the cost by using open source or other such technologies, however in the beginning, your priority is to keep your business running, and if you can get a big supporter to give you a push by using their technology or products embedded into your business such that even they have an incentive to support you, you will go a long way. Since you are creating this idea from scratch and are involved with the entire working of the model, and you are also involved in marketing, and finance etc., getting a big company as your supporter will be of great assistance to you. So always take help from the ecosystem. Lastly, grey hair has to be respected, and that can come as expertise working for you, as a mentor, as a guide, as a professor or even as an industry expert, and that is something you have to respect because that insight is something you can never get without experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Many students here do not have proper experience in the fields of business, they do not know marketing or finance and how to create proper working business models. How can engineering students increase their exposure to the business side of things to ease the process of entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>Before being engineering students, you are primarily students. Don't limit yourself right now. The world you have seen in these 18-20 years are enough to create the entire story. In today's world, a samosa seller does not need an expertise in business or samosas, he can figure that out on the go. That basic test has to be done by you, because you aren't that ignorant, and you know a lot. In an institute like DTU, you also have MBA links and you can always engage them at the right stage for expertise. Never hesitate, never think you don't have the capability of doing something. Just for fine tuning or for presenting it to a bigger firm or to a venture capitalist, you can hire a small agency or a PR firm, and you can take your colleagues and your friends who are learning these skills. There are two things, one is Go Do's and the other is Show Do's. So first focus on the Go Do's and then worry about the Show Do's.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any message you have for the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>The message is simply that you have got everything. Great education that has got you here, and great exposure from people both internal and external to help you. Even the sky is not the limit for you. The branch tag also dissuades people from exploring options outside their stream. Someone in Mechanical or Automation might think he would get only Hyundai or Tata Motors. Can you not go in the IoT wing or the supply chain management wing of these big companies? So remove this stigma of branch from your mind. Engineering is a graduation which is a bit high-tech, and makes you use your mind more. Never, never, never be limited by your branch tag.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>Illustration by: Vishrut Sharma</i></p><p><i>You stare at your phone in nervous apprehension, checking and rechecking the service bars to ensure that you’re getting signal. This is it. After scores of emails, phone calls and interviews, you’re finally at the last step of securing an internship with a company of your choice. You’re waiting for that final confirmation call, the call which will determine whether you’ll spend the summer brooding in Firozpur or interning in Mumbai.</i></p><p><i>The phone rings. The caller asks if he’s speaking to the correct person, tells you that he’s from the HR team. Congratulations, he says, you’ve secured the internship. Your heart swells. Visions of a stellar CV float before your eyes. The HR guy continues to talk, informing you about the department you’ll be working in, the duration of your internship, and myriad other details. You’re waiting for him to mention one major detail, though, the piece of information that could change everything.</i></p><p><i>Sir? you venture to ask. What about the…stipend?</i></p><p><i>There’s an awkward silence at the other end of the line.</i></p><p><i>There’s no monetary stipend, he says, we’ll be paying you in knowledge and experience.</i></p><p><i>Your heart sinks.</i></p><p><i>Will you provide accommodation, then? you ask.</i></p><p><i>Another loaded silence. No, but we can provide lunch on workdays.</i></p><p><i>The cost of travelling, of living in Mumbai…without a stipend, your family just can’t afford it. There’s no way you can afford to take this internship.</i></p><p><i>Your CV vanishes.</i></p><p>Every year, thousands of students from various spheres of life apply for internships. For some, such as those studying engineering and law, internships are essentially mandatory in order to earn a degree. Even if they weren’t mandatory, the importance of internships in a student’s life is not to be undermined. Suffice it to say, in an increasingly competitive world, undergraduate students are desperate for internships.</p><p>Unfortunately, companies often use this desperation to their advantage. There is a scene in Orange Is the New Black in which a character is tasked with untangling a PR scandal that her employer has become involved in. The solution she presents is, verbatim: “Look up some local university, find some marketing majors, and launch them at the PR problem. Call it an internship with a billion-dollar corporation. <strong>Pay them nothing.</strong> Promise them school credit.” In keeping with the rest of the show, this scene exposes a grim reality: the exploitation of young working professionals to handle grunt work at the cost of a simple certificate.</p><p>My stance on the concept of unpaid internships is straightforward: interns deserve a stipend for their work.</p><p>The experience and exposure gained through an internship is, of course, invaluable, but practically speaking, it is not a good enough return on what is a massive investment of time and knowledge. The purpose of an internship stipend is not just remuneration for the work done by an intern – it is intended to cover living costs. Even a first-year student with negligible skills expends a considerable amount of effort into his/her internship. Tangibly speaking, there is also the money he/she spends on accommodation, food, and travel. So, effectively, unpaid interns are the ones paying for the internship.</p><p>One might argue that since most students actually take on internships to enhance their skills and knowledge in a way only real-life working experience can, it makes sense not to pay them. After all, college students also put time and effort into their studies - doesn’t mean they should get paid. However, there is one very major difference between an intern and a student: the intern’s work benefits his/her employer, which is why interns deserve material remuneration for their work. I reiterate - not paying an intern is simply exploitation of labor.&nbsp;</p><p>Putting aside these ethical considerations, the biggest problem with unpaid internships is the role they play in deepening the class divide. According to a survey conducted by the Chronicle of Higher Education and Marketplace, for many employers, on-the-job experience matters more than a student’s academic record.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rMUKd4w7dCr4NlySSQ6UvSCH6OMN8pwVgNj_EHWCnhOAmcdKuTSf2amzVohNpi3NObSZeL_Z879oCG4ZvRSOGvDrQLCjD2WCBHziiQqK4xGI_2-GzedKn_Kg6B1H9B2oRrLX8NiE\"></figure><p>Therefore, a student who has undertaken better internships would have a better chance of securing a higher-paying job. Since the company refuses to pay our friend at the beginning of this article and he can’t afford to live in Mumbai without a stipend, he will be left struggling to find other ways to elevate his CV to that of his competitors. This is one hurdle his well-to-do classmate won’t have to worry about; he will go on to secure that internship, bolstering his profile and making it easier for him to land a job with a higher CTC.</p><p>For students coming from small towns and remote areas, not being able to afford living costs elsewhere is an additional barrier, as their hometown might not offer <i>any</i> internship opportunities even slightly similar to the ones they’d get elsewhere. This is especially pertinent for students pursuing industry-heavy streams, which could require them to undertake factory internships at various locations.</p><p>Simply put: less money, no way to cover living costs for the internship, lower-paying job, less money for their children, no way to cover living costs…through this cycle, unpaid internships put lower and middle class students at an unfair disadvantage, making it harder for them to reduce economic inequality. Therefore, when companies refuse to pay their interns, they are widening the gap between students coming from weaker financial backgrounds and those who have the privilege of being able to <i>pay</i> for an internship.</p><p>My request to such companies? Please stop exploiting distressed undergraduates. Those few thousands of rupees would barely make a difference to your company’s profits, but could mean the world to a struggling intern.</p>",

    "body": "<p>It was on an ominous afternoon blessed with a slight drizzle when a man wearing a tattered vest over a round exposed belly, and a <i>desi lungi</i> arrived at the doorstep. From the moment he entered the house there was an intense rise in the pressure of the gloomy rooms. He was the reason for the elders’ discomfort. Paranoia entered Mona’s mind when her name was slowly whispered by one of the elders to the <i>desi</i> man. And her heart stopped beating when she saw there was a transaction of money.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation escalated quickly after that. She was summoned by the elders to be presented in front of the <i>desi</i> man. The coercion of the room burst her into tears before she was dragged into the back of a truck. These inevitable circumstances she had seen before. All the other sisters, when came of age, were taken away by the same man.</p><p>As she tried to sleep away from her tiredness, the darkness inside the trunk closed in on her, it pushed her shattered dreams further away. Amidst all her confused fast thoughts, an innocent round teardrop rolled down her cheeks. The closed dark trunk only reminded her about the loneliness of the world. She twisted and turned, changed her posture to find comfort on the metal floor, but the pain remained unchanged despite her frantic efforts. This force of darkness increased the gravity of everything around her and made her thoughts incomprehensible. The elders in their room, slept with a corrupt heart, oblivious to the power of the darkness that consumed their incarnation of a Goddess.</p><p>It was a perfect picture, the sun shining as bright as ever, no signs of clouds whatsoever. On green lush meadows surrounded by the east-facing sunflowers, mistaken for the heavens on another day, was lying a motionless lady, who was skipped, hopped and jumped over by everyone.&nbsp; Her name was supposedly Mona.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Illustration By: &nbsp;Vishrut Sharma&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>Over the past two decades, social media has taken the world by storm. A term that used to be nigh non-existent in the 90s has now suddenly become an inseparable part of every teen in today’s time. Perhaps one of the pillars that human civilization rests on is language, a perennially evolving art form. It enables two individuals from any part of our world to fully and freely express themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Necessity is the mother of invention. The growing need to communicate over larger distances, with a larger group at the same time has contributed to the extravagance surrounding social media. Today, before you meet someone in real life, you have several means to get to know them within a span of minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>What started as a necessity, has now shown its adverse side effects. With a screen to hide behind, the audience chooses the platforms that provide them with an opportunity to wait and think before replying instead of direct interaction. And with the advent of these media platforms, we already have access to a snapshot of their tastes, preferences, likes, and dislikes. They have discredited the benefits of being a conversationalist, and socialising is hence, no longer about getting acquainted with new people or getting to know them and is, more often than not, deemed redundant.&nbsp;</p><p>Or at least it may seem so, for the life one portrays on these digital platforms might not always match up bit by bit to the reality. In the world of social media, perception is everything. To reconcile the conflict between ideality and reality, everyone strives to achieve their image of perfection, and in the process of doing so, they get consumed by it. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. But what does one do when perfection isn’t good enough?</p><p>Ideality is based on an idea; an idea that transmogrifies and moulds over time. But should our ideals be influenced by how we perceive others' lives to be, or should they be something embedded deep inside of us? On the road to self-actualisation, our destination changes as often as our journey forks, which often gets hurt on the juxtaposition of who we are and who we let others perceive us as.</p><p>From a societal point of view, we are driven by competition and achievements to move towards a more idealistic version of us. Since these online platforms let us perceive our profiles to be actual portrayals of ourselves, we tend to display the best parts of our life, while leaving out the more humane aspects. This creates a never-ending cycle, where everyone strives to create content for an audience online, with their esteem and respect relying on their audience’s inept judgments.</p><p>The joy that public appraisal and social acceptance brings, however, is short-lived. In the long run, we see other people having more fun, despite it being a facade. We grow to feel as if we are not adequate, as if we are falling behind, or soon to fade into oblivion. There is no point in chasing this false sense of self, comparing over perceptions of others. Rather than working on creating your ideal online self, invest that time into the greatest resource you have: yourself and work to accomplish your goals to be one step closer to the painting you wished to realise.</p><p>On the canvas of the Wide Web, you are free to paint yourself as you wish, but don’t let your art be influenced by the thousands near you. This world may feel like a race, but everyone has their own finish line. Be expansive, be proud of yourself, and paint your true self, not a facsimile thereof.&nbsp;</p>",

Such was the influence of the Guru, that he has been immortalized as Baba Nanak in Hindu texts, Nanak Shah in Islam and Nanak Lama in Buddhism.&nbsp;</p><p>At a time when India was held hostage by tyrant empires and inter-religious conflicts were common, the birth of Guru Nanak came as a guiding ray of the morning sun after a cold and foggy night. Though unconventional at that time, he vehemently condemned superstitions, caste-biases, and other malpractices that were fuelled by greed disguised as culture. Throughout the course of time, his principles have instructed the society to put humanity above everything, and that humanity is the greatest offering one can present to God. His values reiterate that before being a Hindu, a Muslim or even an Indian, one should become a ‘human’ first, by neglecting the boundaries of differences, ego, and greed, and by engaging in selfless service, striving for social justice and prosperity of all.</p><p>Perhaps, there is no better way to pay obeisance to Guru Nanak Dev ji on this holy occasion, than to remind ourselves his first utterance- “<i>Na Koi Hindu, Na Koi Musalman.”</i></p>",

    "slug": "black-friday-a-consumerist-conundrum-295",
    "body": "<p>The last quarter of each year enjoys the status of being the fun-filled portion as it brings about a series of festivals and events. Among the various celebrations, Christmas and the Gregorian New Year remain fairly common across the globe. In the more Christian centers of the world, other festivals like Thanksgiving join in; and on the opposite end of the cultural spectrum, the Chinese celebrate their Chinese New Year soon after. India observes the two major festivals of Dussehra and Diwali while various others dot the calendar.</p><p>A few things remain constant across these temporal variations – the merry people, the celebrations, and the unabashed spirit of consumerism.</p><p>Festivals tend to lose their original meaning while they all morph into celebratory shopping sprees. Not that this piece seeks to discuss or change the viewpoint on the <i>interpretation</i> of festivals - that is a wholly different topic.</p><p>Festivals are potentially the best time to be a <i>seller </i>– one essential half of the sale. With people already looking to celebrate and spend, festivals prove to be the perfect catalyst to pump up the sales. Marketers drive the thirst for acquisition in their consumers.</p><p>They capitalize on the populace the best they can: this goes from ads spanning pages in every major newspaper to through the personal touch targeted online advertisements provide; from frequent notifications on mobile devices to cellular messages from sellers notifying about sales and offers.<br>Each and every one of these is created to get the consumers to, well, consume.</p><p>Eventually, they all normalize over-consumption. Casually strolling through malls with carefully designed advertisements and posters or scrolling through personally targeted products on your Amazon homepage – none of them stick out of the ordinary. A lot of research goes into each element: the advertisement design, placement and the text of content, as well as fine-tuning recommendations to ensure <i>entrapment</i> – essentially making users always find something <i>interesting</i>, regardless of the actual utility.</p><p>In a sale, there is another crucial party involved – the <i>buyer</i>. And they are as interested in consuming as the seller is in getting them to.</p><p>Accumulation is ingrained into the minds of humans through thousands of years of evolution. The name ‘hunter-gatherer’ is no misnomer. Even in today’s abundant world, the buying process stimulates the same heady rush of dopamine that was essential for survival in the more unpredictable times. People, far from being unaware of it, choose to exploit it through retail therapy.</p><p>Consumerism has received half-hearted bashing in pop-culture. Movies like <i>Fight Club</i> make it their point to drag on about the <i>‘evils’</i> of consumerism while classics like <i>They Live</i> showcase the same message from a wildly different viewpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>Their irony is not lost. The end reason for the existence of these movies is, of course, to make a profit. There’s a natural dissonance between self and society. By painting a picture that exploits this dissonance and portrays the audience as <i>better </i>than others, it makes them feel better about themselves. This sense of feel-good is exploited to get people to consume the productions.</p><p>Eventually a quandary arises. Spending more is a non-issue. Expenditure is, in fact, a good indicator of an economy’s status and health. At the same time, with an ever-increasing ensemble of products designed to pique your inner <i>gatherer</i>, marketers have created the perfect trap to drive their own profits up.&nbsp;<br>An economy with abnormal over-spending or under-spending is not healthy, and neither is the normalization of a culture that promotes mindless consumption.</p>",

How would you describe the evolution of NSS throughout these years and how has it benefited the volunteers as well as the community?</strong></p><p>NSS has come really far ahead from the point of its inception in 1969. The evolution has also expanded our domain of work to a great extent. NSS DTU is the largest student-volunteer organisation on our campus with over 300 volunteers. The society has a variety of projects and events belonging to almost every possible domain. Three years back, the society had very few events but today we have events almost every week and a plethora of opportunities to volunteer. Apart from the addition of new projects like Voter ID camps, Recycle Today, Voice of animals, Juvenile Centre visits and Paathshala, our existing projects have also evolved. For example, Kalam Ko Salam used to have weekly visits to a nearby open shelter but now it has daily visits. Another important aspect of this growth story has been the rising influence of social media and our online campaigns like Green Diwali and awareness posts in cases of humanitarian crises. Our Recycle Today project collected more than 2800 Kg of waste paper and recycled it into more than 1900 notebooks for distribution among the underprivileged in just its Phase I. All this has been possible due to the hard work of our seniors and volunteers who have worked selflessly for the benefit of the masses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DTU has plenty of animals on campus and many a times students face a variety of issues regarding this. Have any measures been taken to deal with such situations?</strong></p><p>Under the banner of Voice of Animals, we have many active volunteers who always come forward to help animals in need. We receive calls and messages from people for supporting animals in the campus and the number of such SOS calls is growing each year. Our initiatives have ranged from vaccinating dogs to even holding animal welfare sessions in collaboration with animal rights activists. One improvement we are looking forward to is getting the people around us more aware so that they don't always wait for us to act, rather, they themselves become the ones who lend a helping hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mental health is an important issue these days and measures to remove the stigma associated with it are being discussed widely. How has NSS DTU incorporated mental health into its agenda?</strong></p><p>NSS DTU has organised workshops in the university related to the same in the past. We have had acclaimed psychiatrists take these sessions. They were designed to educate students about how they should try to resolve issues related to anxiety, depression, trauma, etc., wherein both the case of the person being the victim, as well as the comforter, were taken care of. Another way in which the agenda of mental health has been picked up by us is the organisation of Adolescent Awareness camps in schools. Through these camps, the volunteers try and listen to the problems of teenagers hitting puberty and also try to dissociate the stigma that puberty carries around it. They also try to help prevent the bullying and shaming one is subjected to while hitting puberty due to the ignorance of one’s peers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the barriers you face while putting up events, campaigns or delegating work to volunteers for various programs and how do you overcome these barriers?</strong></p><p>Our greatest strength lies in our number of volunteers but it also often becomes the biggest issue with our events/projects. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to motivate such a large team to remain active and volunteer for events. Also, coordinating such a humongous team becomes a tedious task. The fact that most of the students are day scholars further aggravates the problem. We are confined to having events on free slots of volunteers because one cannot have events post academic hours (6 PM onwards). We have quite a few volunteers from B. Tech. (Evening), we have to ensure that they get a fair chance of participation.&nbsp;</p><p>One of our most effective tactics to deal with this problem has been replicating the decentralization model one observes in organisations. The structure of NSS DTU is such that all new recruits are assigned to groups of around 10 people with two mentors, who are among the most active volunteers recruited in the previous year. These mentors guide the new recruits regarding the workings of the society and take periodic updates to ensure that they are volunteering for events/projects. The entire body is managed by a group of Executives and the Council which is horizontal so as to promote decentralization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think your previous councils have done well and what would you like to implement differently to meet your vision for the current academic year?</strong></p><p>The most important legacy of our previous councils, in our opinion, has been the horizontal structure of our council. Every council member is equal and has an equal say in all major decisions. This leads to all department/sector heads being independent in taking initiatives under their respective domains. We believe this has been an important factor in facilitating the increase in the number of events/projects. We have recruited a greater number of volunteers this year, foreseeing the continuation of greater volunteering opportunities and to avoid situations like last year when we had to even call for volunteers from outside the society to fulfil our requirements.</p><p>The previous councils have kept the NSS community very well bonded along with increasing the number of initiatives. This is very important for any community. We need to continuously evolve so that we can look for solutions in a more efficient manner. The only thing that has to be maintained more efficiently is the interaction among the newer volunteers of the society which is slightly less as compared to that among the senior, more active volunteers. This academic year, we aim to increase the same with a greater number of departmental meetings and keep up the legacy of the previous councils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are your criteria for recruiting students to work with NSS and what would you like to say to those wishing to work with NSS in the future?</strong></p><p>We receive close to 500 applications every year. We usually select more than a third of these. There is only one criterion to become a part of NSS, and that is the <i>zest to serve</i>. Anyone who shares the collective mindset of <i>\"Not Me But You\"</i> is humbly welcome. We are a group of individuals whose ultimate goal is to bring about a positive change in the society through our actions. Thus, there is no single criterion which fits all schemes in NSS. Anyone wishing to join NSS should not focus on the role they play in bringing about this change, rather there should be a motivation to actually realise that change.</p><p>Students who want to be a part of and lead positive change in the society should join NSS. It will not just provide them with opportunities to volunteer but they will learn how to solve problems and tackle challenges. They will not just contribute towards developing the nation but in the process develop themselves (into better citizens) as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Shivam Jha, Editor-in-Chief</strong></p><p><i>When was the last time you read a book at a stretch, without taking a week-long break in between chapters? Or rather when was the last time you actually read a full-length book?</i><br><br>All the regular readers I know are stuck on some book. Perhaps you’re stuck on some book right now as well. You are on page 173 and you are unable to go on any further but you know you should finish the book, so what do you do? You give up reading for a while, and devote time to things that require your immediate attention, and hope to resume with a clear mind later.<br><br>That, for me, is a tragedy because I grew up on books, and then I switched to blogs and then I switched to Twitter and Facebook, only to realise I wasn’t really learning anything substantial -- so I went back to essays and books. Reading on social media deludes you enough into thinking you are trying to gain valuable insight into issues when you're actually far away from it. As much you may try to convince yourself otherwise, the truth remains that consuming content on social media websites is nothing but just taking little dopamine snacks all day long.&nbsp;<br><br><i>So, are you stuck on some book right now?</i><br>Maybe.<br>Maybe not.&nbsp;<br>Either way, you know that feeling because you’ve been there before. We all have.</p><blockquote><p>After being stuck long enough, quitting a book is almost like ending a relationship. The emotions are not as intense, but the process is similar. We avoid the decision for weeks, accumulate guilt, and hope that things will improve; but deep inside, we know that we’re delaying the inevitable.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes the book isn’t bad — you just never feel like reading it. The prevailing wisdom is to power through, but that is<i><strong> terrible advice.</strong></i><br>And when the book is critically-acclaimed, it’s even harder. I experienced this while reading Nassim Taleb's<i> \"Fooled by Randomness\", </i>the first book of the Incerto series.&nbsp;<br>About a third of the way in I hit a wall. Perhaps I couldn't get a hang of the rife statistical theories throughout the book. But even after several attempts, I never felt like reading it. And the most annoying part? The book was actually good.<br><br>I gave it a month, then two, then three. It didn’t help.<br>Soon enough, whenever I heard about an interesting book,  ( which happens at least once a week ) I would get excited for a second, but then remind myself that I have to finish “<i>Fooled by Randomness” </i>first, and my excitement will fade and turn into guilt.<br><br>These<strong> sunk costs</strong> have an enormous influence on our decisions.<br>When you are midway through a book, you have invested hours into it and t that point, finishing the book feels like the only way to redeem our investment.&nbsp;<br>The same analogy can be drawn to understand the <strong>opportunity cost </strong>of our decisions. Every day that you spend being stuck or reluctantly reading a mediocre book, is a day you could have spent engaged with fascinating and impactful works. Living in a world of information overabundance, the opportunity cost of being stuck in your learning is way beyond the price of a new book.<br><br>However, one of the perils that come along with an acquired taste for literature is the affinity for<i><strong> reading a great book only once</strong></i>. In the first read, some books fit so perfectly into a certain part of my heart, that I’m worried they won’t fall into the same congruence upon rereading. Some narratives are just so poetic and so sensual that it can make you feel things in a way you didn't know you could.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.” –Francis Bacon</p></blockquote><p><br>And there is a multitude of factors that made the first reading experience special: the sandwich I ate alongside Woolf in a train, the blankets that covered Orwell and me, even the melancholy that enveloped my reading with Robinson.&nbsp;<br><i><strong>You just can’t recreate that first experience.</strong></i><br>It’s like taking a picture of a bonfire — it’s never quite as beautiful upon a second view; you can’t smell the smoke, or hear the crackling, or feel the fire’s warmth on your face.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm afraid that you can’t, unfortunately, love a book as much as you did the first time you read it. So I look at these titles, tucked away happily on my shelves as markers of times in my life, and know the words in their pages but that's exactly how they'll stay.&nbsp;</p><p>There are significant benefits to reading a <i><strong>variety of genres </strong></i>as well. Don’t pigeonhole yourself into thinking you only like one genre. I am almost always reading one fiction and one non-fiction book at the same time. Your mind grows as you experience new things, and you learn to connect ideas that prima facie do not have any commonality.&nbsp;<br><br>The aficionados of print literature, like myself, would never be able to read an e-book with the same adulation as we read a yellowed, tattered paperback that preserves some remnants from each of its previous readers, and somehow makes us feel connected to all the people who held this book before us. With digital devices, you really only get one sense involved — sight. But with a physical book, which engages three of your senses, you are completely drawn into the activity of reading, making it a far more immersive experience.&nbsp;<br><br>In these e-everything times of 24x7 news channels and streaming video sites, when the death of the print newspaper is considered a certainty, we are just a book away from re-imagining the vanished passion for reading in a small bookless library room full of those supposedly dying entities. This is the age of distraction, and it's up to you to consciously curate the things that excite and distract you. So read as much as you can, because the time constraint only shrivels from here on.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to recommend an incredible podcast which partly inspired this editorial.&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/\"><strong>The 18th Episode of The Knowledge Project</strong></a> where <a href=\"https://theangelphilosopher.com/\"><strong>Naval Ravikant</strong></a><strong> </strong>discusses reading, happiness, decision making, habits, and mental models. It's two hours long, but worth every minute, provided you are habituated to podcasts.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>- Kripi Badonia, 4th year, IT</strong></p><p>Reclaim a table at Mic Mac just to sit for hours and talk about everything under the sun – from Chandan Bhaiya’s episodes to when you got detained at 69% attendance, while fighting over whether Rajma Chawal tastes better with Maggi Masala or not. Feel the warmth the friend circle once again under the winter sun, while those age-old Bluetooth speakers play your chill jam at your spot in the OAT, and remember that day of the 5th semester when you decided to skip all your classes to enjoy that one moment right here, on this bench.</p><p>Smile at Nescafe and remember planning everything from Engifest to majors and minors to that trip to Goa (that probably never happened) over endless cups of tea and coffee, and make your way to MechC whose Masala Dosa and Chole Bhature were your rescue to an empty stomach and an equally empty wallet. And today, talk to the Amul crowd – people you never really spoke to in college, but always saw them loitering and laughing around Amul’s trail of PR desks and banners.&nbsp;</p><p>Visit the classrooms where endless banter ensued for 4 years and remember debating with your 1st year friends about where you want to go in that 3 hour break. (A lot of time for G3S? Not enough time for GTB?) And lastly, walk around the campus recalling every memory – the fights, the drama, the bliss, the happiness, the family, and find your four years etched into every brick, every pavement of this University.</p><p>Walk up to your hostel room, and see how the newbies have changed its look, and feel the nostalgia hit you hard. Home is where the heart is, and you will find yours in that balcony where you’ve spent many nights in introspection. You will find yours in that room with the best gaming setup, where you played FIFA for 6 hours straight and only stopped because there was a mid semester the next day.&nbsp;</p><p>You will find yours in that mess where food was the common misery, and<i> ‘aaj bahar ka khaa lete hai yaar</i>’ was all the unison you needed. You will find yours on those steps and that corridor where you spent hours on the phone talking to your significant others. You will find yours in that ‘jam’ room where your ‘guitar-friend’ would lace the evenings with live music.&nbsp;</p><p>You will find yours in your favourite senior’s hostel room, where you’ve gone innumerable times for advice and to chill, all the same. And when you find it, keep it back. Your hostels should always be the living memory of the person you were when you came in and the person you were when you left.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>• Ek baar bas •</strong></i><br><br>There’s no next semester that you can plan on nailing, so as to maintain your average. There’s probably going to be no other time where all of your batch-mates and juniors will be together in one place. There isn’t going to be another final culmination of engineering degree again either. This time, your parents will decidedly be proud of you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><i><strong>Tomorrow, is what you’ll have – the last memory of the place that you devoted 6 years of your life (for 11th and 12th were the worst).</strong></i>&nbsp;<br>One more time with your friends to plan that getaway trip (from the humdrum of your jobs and MS, MBA that give no space to breathe).&nbsp;<br>One more time to take Bawana-land all in.&nbsp;<br>One more time to feel Sanam’s version of <i>“Lag jaa gale, ki phir ye haseen raat ho na ho…”.&nbsp;</i><br>One more time to feel like a DTUite again.<br>&nbsp;<br>The time to finally be called, an engineer.</p>",

What all responsibilities does the Sports council, DTU has when it comes to organizing the annual sports and athletics event- Aahvaan?</strong></p><p>More than 2000 participants from all across India participate in Aahvaan, the annual sports fest of DTU. The primary responsibilities of the Sports Council in Aahvaan include- drafting a suitable budget along with inviting all the universities across India as well as publicizing the fest. It’s the Sports Council’s duty to build a strong PR and publicity team for the fest. Hospitality is another significant section that needs our attention. It includes providing proper accommodation and food facilities to the participants. More than thirteen sports are played in Aahvaan and arranging proper equipment and officials for the fair play of these sports is also our responsibility.</p><p><strong>Q. What are the different problems that you encountered during last year's events, and how do you plan to resolve them?</strong></p><p>There were a few significant problems that we encountered during last year's fest. A strong team is required at the core for any fest; a fest cannot be great with just a handful of people working for it. This year we will make sure to build a proper team for every department which will hopefully fulfil lasts year's voids. We also faced issues due to the dates of the fest. Last year's dates were coinciding with the semester examinations of several universities. This resulted in a significant drop in participation. The dates of Aahvaan have been set keeping these factors in mind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q. What steps can the council take in order to increase the participation of students in outdoor games?&nbsp; How can you motivate students so that they involve themselves in sport, which is an essential discipline in life?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Incorporation of sports in the curriculum is something that DTU has adopted through FEC, since the batch of 2018, which has proven to be a golden move to encourage participation in outdoor games. Besides this, proper grounds and facilities will surely help in encouraging more students to spend their time outdoors.</p><p>Sports Council also organises two outside-Delhi tours for our sports contingent. This brings motivation to all the players to practice hard and make it into the team. An inter-department sports fest, Arena, is also conducted annually, which is open to all the students for participation.</p><p><strong>Q. What are your views regarding the coaches and support staff presently at DTU, and how does the council plan to improve the current scenario of mentors for various sports?</strong></p><p>DTU introduced the coaching staff in 2018 with the introduction of FEC-Sports. Since the arrival of coaches, the level of sports in DTU has elevated drastically. We have performed brilliantly in various inter-university tournaments including the sports fest of IIT-K and BITS-Goa. DTU has left a positive mark in almost every major sporting event in these universities. Some of the sports do not have a coach yet, but the council is continuously working to appoint qualified coaches for these sports.</p><p><strong>Q. What new initiatives has the Sports Council planned for this year?</strong></p><p>The council has multiple new initiatives in mind and will try its level best to execute them over the course of the year. These include organising multiple mini-marathons for students as well as faculty members of DTU, easing the process for providing sports equipment to each and every student of DTU, organising an inter-hostel sports fest- Aaghaz and focussing on female matches for all sports to further improve the participation of girls.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>Photograph by: ACS-DTU and IIChE DTU Chapter</i></p><p><i>DTU Times interviewed Abhijeet Singh, Founder, StepVue, who was in DTU for a Career Consulting Workshop organized by ACS-DTU and IIChE DTU Chapter in collaboration with StepVue.</i></p><p><strong>How does coming back to DTU after all these years feel?</strong></p><p>DTU has been a home to me right from the start, and whatever I am today is because of this place. Coming back here always feels like a homecoming and is one of the most amazing feelings one can ever experience. The excitement and vibes you get on the campus, especially the beauty of its design, always makes me feel upbeat.</p><p><strong>How does being an alumnus of DTU impact you professionally? Is there anything that college taught you that made a special contribution to your career?</strong></p><p>I think that one gains a lot of experience in a place like DTU. It is here that I learnt the importance of having a great network and a cooperative peer group. Most of the things that I achieved in the early days of my career were due to the network of people that I created during my college days. They were superbly supportive of me, even when I graduated and moved out. Not just your batchmates, but also the seniors who graduate prior to you and are in the job market are ever ready to assist you. DTU has one of the strongest student communities and the alumni of DTU will help you out through thick and thin. No matter what phase of life you are in, there is always guidance available if you reach out.</p><p><strong>How did you handle the switch between DTU and the Rotterdam School of Management?</strong></p><p>When I joined GAIL after college, I was at a very comfortable place in my life, but the leisure is what got to me. Hence, I decided to switch things up. Human beings have a tendency to get used to their comfort zones, yet I have always tried to come out of mine. After spending some years at GAIL, I decided that since I had lived in India all my life, I needed some overseas experience. I wanted to have a global outlook towards business and that is what drove me towards Rotterdam.</p><p>The experience at RSM was phenomenal. Everything was extremely organized, people went out of their way to help you, and the structure and order in your everyday life was extremely inspiring. I was used to chaos, and the difference made me a little uncomfortable at first. I learnt the importance of having a functional work-life balance, and gained a lot of insight and professionalism because of the time I spent in the Netherlands. The immense diversity was also very motivating - I had classmates from 35 different nations, all studying together! Everyone came from very different backgrounds, from marines to fashion, and yet we were learning the same curriculum.</p><p><strong>How is networking with the peer group at a foreign institute different from networking at an Indian institute?</strong></p><p>At an Indian B-school such as the ISB or an IIM, if there are a hundred students enrolled, nearly 80 students would be getting a job in India and hence, would be residing here. However, if you want to build a global network, that is where Rotterdam School of Management - or any other foreign B-school, for that matter - would be a real help to you. You spend a whole year with students hailing from a multitude of countries. Once the program is over, they go in different directions, different countries and different roles. This diversifies your network. Thanks to this, my network has expanded to Japan, Australia, the whole of Europe and even Africa. This gives you the avenue of getting to know a country first-hand, as I can call up any of my acquaintances and get the required information easily. I can do this for any part of the world, since my alumni network is spread across almost every country. I have been with people of varied nationalities, and each one of them has imparted me with a life experience of their own. When you work with a global team in a time bound-environment, it helps you to understand how their cultures shape their personalities.</p><p><strong>What were the key factors which made you decide to establish a company in India instead of establishing it elsewhere?</strong></p><p>I had an opportunity to work with Adidas Netherlands on a living management project. Though it wasn’t exactly an internship, it provided some useful insights into how Adidas worked. After completing my MBA program, I moved back to India. There is an inherent advantage in founding a company in India due to high demand. Imagine that you are doing something niche which caters to a specific section of the total population. In a country with a total population of 2 million, your product would target a small audience, and you might not even find a break in that country. India, however, is one of the biggest markets in the world. This is because of the huge chunk of population that resides here. Due to this, no matter how good or bad your product is, you will always a healthy market for it in India. Hence, founding a start-up in India makes the economies of scale work in favour of that start-up, as the market, the opportunities, and the possibilities are huge.</p><p><strong>Since you have worked in the core technical as well as the consulting industry, how has the transition between the two sectors been?</strong></p><p>I believe that it is not difficult to make a transition between the two industries. The only major transition which one needs to make is a change of mindset. When you are working in a PSU, you need to possess a certain mindset. There is a specific workflow which is the right way of doing things in a public sector environment. However, when you transition into a corporate or a start-up environment, you need to adjust your mindset. You have to be clear about what is expected from your new role, and you shouldn’t bring the ‘baggage’ from the previous role. Do not get stuck with the old workflow; whatever is being offered at the new company, appreciate it and adapt yourself.</p><p><strong>Is there any final advice you would like to share with the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>For the students of DTU, I would suggest that you should enjoy your time here. It might sound like a cliché, but the four years you spend here are going to be some of the best memories of your life. The friends you have made at DTU will stick with you for quite a long time in your career. You cannot say the same for an MBA or any other post-grad journey. This place is special, and so are the people who come here. One should focus on academics as well, but try to follow a balanced approach towards learning and experiencing the vast aspects of college life.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed the members of the current Literature and Film Council, DTU- Sahil Bansal, Himanshu Hooda (Fest Secretaries), Nikhil Pal and Niyanta Mehra (Treasurers)</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q. Yuvaan always has very interesting themes with layers of perception underneath them. What leads to the creation of such unique themes? This year's theme is Eden De Übermensch, meaning- Garden of Superheroes. How would such a theme influence the events and competitions in Yuvaan?</strong></p><p>Yuvaan aims to touch upon themes through which we can explore everything relevant to literature and films. These ideas are born from the simplest of things we are surrounded by that go unnoticed, which is the essence of literature and art. The theme should always be open to interpretation and each one should have their own unique set of expectations from the theme. As for this year’s theme- Eden de Übermensch, it is to commemorate the superheroes in and around us. Since it is a broad theme, it wouldn’t directly reflect in the events and competitions to be held, but there is definitely an indirect link. We believe it represents the very fiber of being for this fest.</p><p><strong>Q. With the advent of the digital age, e-books and online subscriptions to magazines, how do you think literature has morphed in modern times and what role does it hold now?</strong></p><p>In this day and age, opening a book and diving right into it for pleasure has transformed into much more technologically advanced hobbies. Now, we have material to read online, audiobooks, etc. This adds a new perspective to literature, as now people can even read their favorite stories on the go and in more compact forms. Although, the advent of such technology has caused old-fashioned reading to take a backseat, it’s not necessarily a disadvantage as this has opened avenues for a different set of people to take up reading.</p><p><strong>Q. Last year's fest saw many renowned guests. How do you think college students benefit from motivational speakers and celebrities alike?</strong></p><p>The guests during our fest are personalities many college students look up to for various reasons. Inviting them and giving the students a chance to see their real-life heroes and listen to what they have to say creates a huge impact. Yuvaan not only provides a platform to escape from the monotonous college life through fun-filled activities, it also sets the stage for many to derive inspiration from those gracing our fest.</p><p><strong>Q. Being students of a technical university, literature isn't a major part of our academia. How does Yuvaan help in engrossing the students in the fields of art and literature?</strong></p><p>With DTUites engrossed in tackling engineering problems on a daily basis, a fest like Yuvaan provides them with a medium to explore a different sphere of life by adding a different touch to the lives we lead as to-be engineers. Through the multitude of events and a very happening 3 days, these students get a chance to delve into a parallel world, where imagination and creativity take over technicalities.</p><p><strong>Q. Being a part of the council of a major fest can be a daunting task. What are some of the lesser known responsibilities and challenges of holding such a post?</strong></p><p>Yuvaan is a relatively new fest and that makes the task of organizing such a fest almost twice as daunting. Yuvaan is just an adolescent in the world of fests, and to make sure that it grows to be substantial in terms of the events conducted and take- aways for the participants and audience is a huge responsibility. Apart from regular issues like fund allocation, staying on schedule, ensuring a wide outreach, a problem to be addressed is remaining motivated and ensuring that the rest of the team is also constantly motivated, because the team is the backbone of the fest and to ensure everything goes according to plan, our foundations must be strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

We also interviewed his batchmates Mr. Gulshan Kapoor, Mr. Subha Rao, Mr. Sudhir Khanna, Mr. Suman K. Kwatra, and Mr. Umesh Chaddha.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What are the major changes you have seen between DCE of 1971 and DTU of 2019?</strong></p><p>The DCE in 1971 was a small place. I can draw a whole map for you consisting of the library and the four departments. This campus is a huge one, of area 165 acres, while our campus was only around 10 acres at Kashmere Gate. There is no comparison; what you are doing here is amazing. In 1971, probably less than 250 students passed out, while here, almost 1800 students graduated this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engineers today in India are failing to capture the wide gap between the academic curriculum and industry requirements. What do you think students should do at an individual level to bridge this gap?</strong></p><p>There always will be a difference in the industry here and the industry abroad, and that is why I went abroad to get my Masters degree. Nowadays, however, I see a lot of PhD students here, so hopefully, we are improving the scope for higher studies here as well. But earlier, going abroad was the only way to dig deeper into a subject. There are a number of job-ready courses these days which are gaining prominence. These are aimed at bridging the gap between what is taught in the university and what is required in the industry.</p><p>Don’t work too long for one organisation. 5-7 years is a good time to switch. If you are there in any organisation, look for opportunities to show your brilliance.

We also interviewed his batchmates Mr. Gulshan Kapoor, Mr. Subha Rao, Mr. Sudhir Khanna, Mr. Suman K. Kwatra, and Mr. Umesh Chaddha.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What are the major changes you have seen between DCE of 1971 and DTU of 2019?</strong></p><p>The DCE in 1971 was a small place. I can draw a whole map for you consisting of the library and the four departments. This campus is a huge one, of area 165 acres, while our campus was only around 10 acres at Kashmere Gate. There is no comparison; what you are doing here is amazing. In 1971, probably less than 250 students passed out, while here, almost 1800 students graduated this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engineers today in India are failing to capture the wide gap between the academic curriculum and industry requirements. What do you think students should do at an individual level to bridge this gap?</strong></p><p>There always will be a difference in the industry here and the industry abroad, and that is why I went abroad to get my Masters degree. Nowadays, however, I see a lot of PhD students here, so hopefully, we are improving the scope for higher studies here as well. But earlier, going abroad was the only way to dig deeper into a subject. There are a number of job-ready courses these days which are gaining prominence. These are aimed at bridging the gap between what is taught in the university and what is required in the industry.</p><p>Don’t work too long for one organisation. 5-7 years is a good time to switch. If you are there in any organisation, look for opportunities to show your brilliance. Every organisation has, whether you like it or not, Power Centers, which would really put you into a proper perspective. Don’t just blindly work and deliver, but also observe the people around you and learn from them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A lot of engineers generally go for non-technical jobs, as opposed to core technical work.

The guests were present for the La Gossipe panel in Yuvaan Literature and Film Festival 2020.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Did you ever plan to become a YouTube celebrity or was it something you stumbled upon?</strong></p><p><i><strong>Ayush</strong></i><strong>: My plan was very simple as I was always interested in the world of films. The beautiful cinematic representations of mundane things were always exciting. I wanted to stick in this field. Even if I hadn't been acting, I would either be writing or producing. I wish to direct my own feature someday.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Kriti:</strong></i><strong> I had zero plans. Initially, I wanted to be Miss World but I fell short in terms of height. I really enjoyed acting and I was always looking to get away from studies. During college days, I started acting in street plays fell in love with it. I believe I am extremely comfortable in front of the camera due to my time doing theatre in school. The camera was my best friend. I never planned this career and just went with the flow.</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0aY6OcpCzLAT_lkUt3gQcXf3_uFWrLRbzC2-JEgfhvnBkzbvnXSZu38wzuXiACGX3xlp4_TYZkf0UE55vvZV3ligUifDIxgfuQNJdv6TpgSPULac9C7jw8Yb8x7Jv3I8UFyFcVsV\"></figure><p><strong>Sushant Singh Rajput is an alumnus of our University. Did you ever feel the engineer vibes while working with him?</strong></p><p><i><strong>Sanjana: </strong></i><strong>I definitely felt the vibes. There was a lot to learn from him because he is a very good actor. We were both very nerdy about how we approached the script and our method was slightly similar as well. He uses markers and post-its quite efficiently. I used to think that my script was worn out but his script used to be so very wholesome.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Ayush:</strong></i><strong> I also remember working with him for the movie ‘Drive’. He had an entire notebook about his backstory for the film. In psychology, there is something called the personality test and he gets it done for his characters. He makes an entire file out of it.</strong></p><p><strong>What do you consider when selecting a script and acting it out?</strong></p><p><strong>It’s a lot which goes in. I generally don’t like repeating what I have been doing (the romantic stuff). So there is not much scope in that. The channel has a certain protocol to follow; they have to make sweet romantic stuff and they will continue to do that. So the idea is to play it a little differently even though you are playing the same thing. Love for brother, love for mother, love for girlfriend and love for girlfriend of two years would be entirely different. I try to find the balance and not repeat something I did a year ago.</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aDedSxx-8khz8Ndusqc04uwBDItysEMIjPLzTNIFGy3zGgDiKCT3YvOGFEhyB2ouOVr_fLlxztGkwoxVUd1pGYFwG_UNz-KcqCNXQp9rM5AbMKf32oRm1Ll0oNZjU3NWpD1LGyTK\"></figure><p><strong>What would be your message to the students who wish to pursue arts after engineering?</strong></p><p><i><strong>Ayush</strong></i><strong>: I want to tell them that it is alright to fail. Failure is very important in life. It is okay if one fails 55 times, since he may succeed in his next attempt. Just keep at it. Do not lose your will which is the most important thing in life.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Priyam</strong></i><strong>: I believe one needs to have a healthy detachment from what one is pursuing at the moment. It might not always be the thing you end up doing later in life.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Kriti: </strong></i><strong>Whatever you end up studying in college can always prove beneficial in future, even if you end up pursuing something entirely different. Having formal education provides you an edge, but not going to college&nbsp; doesn’t disqualify you from being successful in this field either.</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sN_RrfPL4IaeviGPIa2lcR0msOeFIerd2GD6GL6aXPTFW9ry4r_GUMAe3lvQtxXg0PlGlryOPQpL2BU-EjMQMCI7mZgSQg_9IG4RHz-sVaka9QGlC-g6q-iKea7HM23zEYRUdYSU\"></figure>",

    "body": "<ol><li><i>DTU Times interviewed Dhruv Sehgal, Ambrish Verma and Viraj Gehlani from Filtercopy during Yuvaan, the Literature and Film Festival of DTU, 2020</i><br><br><strong>How did your college life in DCE contribute to the profession that you’re currently a part of?&nbsp;</strong><br>It wasn’t a lot about the relevant skills added to what I'm doing but I did a lot to the characters. I learnt how to draw my characters from real life. Moreover, college was a very important part of my holistic and personal development. I learnt how to talk to people, see the thick and thin through life, how to manage work etc. All of these lessons are essential for everyone, regardless of the field they’re going in. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>In a climate as socially sensitive as ours, what guidelines have you set for yourself while writing in order to ensure that your content is positively received across all generations?&nbsp;</strong><br>I always try to make my next project better than my last one. Even if it doesn’t turn out as well as the previous one, there’s always an attempt to put in more effort and thought into it. &nbsp;<br>I try to see the audience of the content I’ll be posting. It depends on whether the video will have more shares or more tags, the type of community that will relate to this video the most. These 3 factors are kept into account along with our previous experiences. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What’s the difference between writing for a streaming service or YouTube channel or your social media platform?&nbsp;</strong><br>You try to gauge the type of audience that predominantly uses the platform. Audience differs from platform to platform. TikTok has a mass audience, whereas YouTube has a combination of mass as well as an urban audience, Instagram - on the other hand - consists primarily of an urban audience. You get to know about your audience after experimenting. You fail a couple of times and get to know about it through comments. There’s a thing in the digital industry, it’s that you get immediate feedback now. Earlier, a movie would get released and the filmmakers would have to wait over the weekend to see what the critics have to say. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do either of you prefer to write your own characters and if so, how much do you pick up from your own personal lives?&nbsp;</strong><br>I really prefer writing my own characters. You are more accountable then, definitely. And when somebody else is approaching you, they have some other objective in their mind. &nbsp;<br>The best part about writing your own characters is that it gives you more control. In our industry, there are several external factors that control the quality of your work. Usually, as an actor, you have to work with a script that the director received externally and then selected you for a particular role. You may perform well but a way to reduce risk altogether is by writing your character and taking at least one of the things about your work in your own hands. &nbsp;<br>It also helps in taking the edge off your acting skills. If you write yourself a character, you’ll naturally be more comfortable in doing that part since it’ll be a heavy reflection of how you actually behave in real life. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Is there a difference between filming for a streaming service, your own YouTube channel or your personal social media handle?&nbsp;</strong><br>It differs a lot on the basis of the craft. If you’re making content for YouTube, you know that you have him for a minute but if you’re making a movie, you know that you have to gauge the audience’s attention for at least 30 minutes. &nbsp;<br>A study recently revealed that an average user watches a video on Facebook only for 3 seconds. The time frame goes down to 1 second for Instagram videos. This shows that your content needs to be very crisp, popping and attention grabbing to get the audience. This really helps you know how much work you need to put in. &nbsp;<br>It’s also very important to know that you’re working for the right platform. Say, you’re a phenomenal writer but you might suck at YouTube; that’s because you might write something with intricate emotional depth but YouTube’s audience isn’t the one that’s interested in content like that. They’re the ones who just want to watch something at the end of the day that helps them unwind and relax. Hence, you can’t go overly emotional on YouTube. However, Netflix has an audience that has specially paid to watch content that’s different from the content on YouTube. Therefore, if a creator wants to experiment with content, he should know his platforms and the audiences that come along. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you prefer to work freelance or be associated with an organisation?&nbsp;</strong><br>Every organisation has a mandate that’s different from the other. If you’re working for a company, the mandate of your personal/work life should match with the mandate of that organisation. So, it wouldn’t matter even if you want to write the best detective story ever if your organisation simply doesn’t want it. In totality, your core values should match with the core values of the people you’re working with. That, in my opinion, is the biggest thing to find. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Seeing that you’ve worked for Little Things as well as normal shorts, which of the two is harder to execute?&nbsp;</strong><br>It’s definitely harder to make a very good 2-3 minute video than to make an average sitcom. It all depends on the intent of the creator. Many people create videos just for the sake of putting out more content, that should not be how you view your work. One should always have a clear intent in mind when they’re in the process of content creation. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What is it like to be a writer who’s forte is in offbeat content? What’s the journey like when you know that your content is different than what normally sells?&nbsp;</strong><br>It’s the best time to be in this industry. It’s the best time to be writing because now you’re actually getting paid for it. There’s a very big luck factor attached to it. Now that you’re getting paid for it, that means you’ll be held responsible and accountable for it. That’s why it’s important to not take up on projects that offer money but force you to do something that isn’t your cup of tea. It’s crucial to work but to simultaneously retain your individuality during the process. Because at the end of it, your writing should reflect your essence and your personality. If it doesn’t do that, then you’ll become quite replaceable. &nbsp;<br>Everyone has different ways of achieving career fulfillment. If you feel like doing mainstream content continuously to earn enough that you can finally take a 2-year-break and work on your script, go do that. Just be happy with the direction you’re going in. Because earning money is, too, very important because you’re able to get access to better production and better people with more money. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>A couple of years ago, neither of you knew you’d be doing what you’re doing right now. All of you found your calling along the way and made your path. What are your biggest takeaways from your own journeys?&nbsp;</strong><br>My only takeaway was, “Try first, then regret.” You must take all the chances and shots that you’re given. The regret of passing up on an opportunity and then thinking about it later is something that eats you up. Try doing as many things as you can, rather than contemplating about them later. &nbsp;<br>My takeaway revolved around Ikigai. You should try to find what you like doing and try it out. But you should also see if you’re good at it and find a method to make it financially sustainable. &nbsp;<br>I think the biggest takeaway is the desire to be better, but at the same time not losing your life/individuality because of your work. It’s very important to have a very healthy personal life; to love your parents, to love your friends, to be there for them and simultaneously be a good professional. This profession is too romanticised now, which it shouldn’t be. It’s a job at the end of the day. Work for those 8 hours during the day and then go live your life in a healthy manner, one in which your work doesn’t consume your entire life.</li></ol>",

The beautiful cinematic representations of mundane things were always exciting. I wanted to stick in this field. Even if I hadn't been acting, I would either be writing or producing. I wish to direct my own feature someday.</p><p><i>Kriti:</i> I had zero plans. Initially, I wanted to be Miss World but I fell short in terms of height. I really enjoyed acting and I was always looking to get away from studies. During college days, I started acting in street plays fell in love with it. I believe I am extremely comfortable in front of the camera due to my time doing theatre in school. The camera was my best friend. I never planned this career and just went with the flow.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0aY6OcpCzLAT_lkUt3gQcXf3_uFWrLRbzC2-JEgfhvnBkzbvnXSZu38wzuXiACGX3xlp4_TYZkf0UE55vvZV3ligUifDIxgfuQNJdv6TpgSPULac9C7jw8Yb8x7Jv3I8UFyFcVsV\"></figure><p><strong>Sushant Singh Rajput is an alumnus of our University. Did you ever feel the engineer vibes while working with him?</strong></p><p><i>Sanjana: </i>I definitely felt the vibes. There was a lot to learn from him because he is a very good actor. We were both very nerdy about how we approached the script and our method was slightly similar as well. He uses markers and post-its quite efficiently. I used to think that my script was worn out but his script used to be so very wholesome.</p><p><i>Ayush:</i> I also remember working with him for the movie ‘Drive’. He had an entire notebook about his backstory for the film. In psychology, there is something called the personality test and he gets it done for his characters. He makes an entire file out of it.</p><p><strong>What do you consider when selecting a script and acting it out?</strong></p><p>It’s a lot which goes in. I generally don’t like repeating what I have been doing (the romantic stuff). So there is not much scope in that. The channel has a certain protocol to follow; they have to make sweet romantic stuff and they will continue to do that. So the idea is to play it a little differently even though you are playing the same thing. Love for brother, love for mother, love for girlfriend and love for girlfriend of two years would be entirely different. I try to find the balance and not repeat something I did a year ago.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aDedSxx-8khz8Ndusqc04uwBDItysEMIjPLzTNIFGy3zGgDiKCT3YvOGFEhyB2ouOVr_fLlxztGkwoxVUd1pGYFwG_UNz-KcqCNXQp9rM5AbMKf32oRm1Ll0oNZjU3NWpD1LGyTK\"></figure><p><strong>What would be your message to the students who wish to pursue arts after engineering?</strong></p><p><i>Ayush</i>: I want to tell them that it is alright to fail. Failure is very important in life. It is okay if one fails 55 times, since he may succeed in his next attempt. Just keep at it. Do not lose your will which is the most important thing in life.</p><p><i>Priyam</i>: I believe one needs to have a healthy detachment from what one is pursuing at the moment. It might not always be the thing you end up doing later in life.</p><p><i>Kriti: </i>Whatever you end up studying in college can always prove beneficial in future, even if you end up pursuing something entirely different. Having formal education provides you an edge, but not going to college&nbsp; doesn’t disqualify you from being successful in this field either.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sN_RrfPL4IaeviGPIa2lcR0msOeFIerd2GD6GL6aXPTFW9ry4r_GUMAe3lvQtxXg0PlGlryOPQpL2BU-EjMQMCI7mZgSQg_9IG4RHz-sVaka9QGlC-g6q-iKea7HM23zEYRUdYSU\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "slug": "editorial-death-of-a-bachelor-369",
    "body": "<p><i><strong>-Shivam Jha, Editor-in-Chief</strong></i></p><p>For all I know, a death in your acquaintance circle has an acute, dissecting effect on all the people who shared a common lifescape with the person. It pierces the fathomage of your soul and hides in corners you didn’t even know existed until now. Loss doesn’t occur in a vacuum, it is often followed by smaller, more shallow, less finite losses that dilute your perspective on life.&nbsp;<br>And since life is always seemingly teeming with intentions and meanings, the death of each human, or even each creature, really is a <strong>catastrophe</strong>. But we must live with it anyway; for all we know, the alternative is the most desperate and convoluted of denials.&nbsp;<br><br>Through a lapse in my indifference, I was drawn into this recent catastrophe, drawn to make his death my death. This series of events threw me into contemplation and jerrybuilt a number of questions. After all, what are the factors that shape the length and depth of our sorrow?&nbsp;</p><p>Our degree of agony is not proportional to the distance separating us and the site of death but rather inversely proportionate to the degrees of separation between us. No matter how much we try to deny it, the tacit normalisation of suicides in universities and schools is a byproduct of the institutionalized apathy and stigma inculcated through a bland curriculum.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>On average, 28 students committed suicide every day in 2018 in India which comes down to more than one (successful) student suicide every hour, making up 8% of the total in the country. And shockingly, every 3 seconds someone attempts suicide in India. The problem may not be a simulacrum of India’s widespread mental health crisis. And despite these figures, India only spends 0.06% of its health budget on mental healthcare, compared to the 4% or more typically spent by developed nations. Staggering, right?</p></blockquote><p>At the core of the problem lies the forbiddance to discuss or even acknowledge the presence of the problem in our community (classic Indian tactic). Instead of confronting our own mortality, many of us tend to label such talk as<i><strong> “morbid” </strong></i>and try to stave it off — along with death itself — as long as they can. <i>This horror at the death of others is intimately bound up with horror at the prospect of one’s own demise.&nbsp;</i><br><br>We try to hush over the demise of someone, particularly when it's a suicide, afraid that bringing this up will lead to an uncomfortable conversation. However, in order to break through the silence and avoidance that shape contemporary Indian attitudes toward student deaths, <i><strong>we need to have more uncomfortable conversations. </strong></i>We must teach young people different ways to engage with the end of life, rather than shield them from the spectre of mortality. Understandably, not everyone is in an emotional place to have such conversations; it is one thing to study death from the safety and privilege of a classroom setting and another to feel its looming presence.&nbsp;<br><br>Such catastrophes occur each day, and after a brief perfunctory display of dismay, people go on with life like it's usual. Our insensitivity towards the loss of someone with an oblivious coexistence is deeply internalised in our behaviour. With this attitude coupled with administrative apathy and the urge to muffle incidents before they become news, we proceed to overlook the abundance of deaths around us.&nbsp;<br><br>But especially in the urban terrains of a third world city such as New Delhi , a metropolis where there are no quiet places in sight, every death will go noticed. A city with a million cars and rooftops and windows and humans and stories; a city that bustles around the clock amid the well-rehearsed commotion of crowds; a city with people and traffic louder than the next thunder scream and air that’ll smother you in the pretence of keeping you alive. In a city that breathes and chokes by its own density, there are no closed, clear spaces for suicide.<br>Everything and everyone jammed in, all in an earshot of each other, each one privy to the next one’s pain and suffering. <i><strong>In a city like this, almost every death will be done in public.</strong></i> Every suicide by another body living, breathing, being, and coexisting alongside the brick and steel and concrete crowding the pathways.<br><br>While some deaths won't even fortunate enough to receive an obituary or grieved upon, some will be buried - not in graves - but in statistics; and some even worse - forgotten.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Ambrish Verma, Dhruv Sehgal, and Viraj Gehlani during Yuvaan, the Literature and Film Festival, 2020</i><br><br><strong>How did your college life in DCE contribute to the profession that you’re currently a part of?&nbsp;</strong><br>It wasn’t a lot about the relevant skills added to what I'm doing but I learnt how to draw my characters from real life. Moreover, college was a very important part of my holistic and personal development. I learnt how to talk to people, how to manage work, etc. All of these lessons are essential for everyone, regardless of the field they’re going in. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>In a climate as socially sensitive as ours, what guidelines have you set for yourself while writing in order to ensure that your content is positively received across all generations?&nbsp;</strong><br>I always try to make my next project better than my last one. Even if it doesn’t turn out as well as the previous one, there’s always an attempt to put in more effort and thought into it. &nbsp;<br>I try to see the audience of the content I’ll be posting. It depends on whether the video will have more shares or more tags, or the type of community that will relate to this video the most. These 3 factors are kept into account along with our previous experiences. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do either of you prefer to write your own characters and if so, how much do you pick up from your own personal lives?&nbsp;</strong><br>I really prefer writing my own characters. You are more accountable then because when somebody else is approaching you, they have some other objective in their mind. &nbsp;<br>The best part about writing your own characters is that it gives you more control. In our industry, there are several external factors that control the quality of your work. Usually, as an actor, you have to work with a script that the director received externally and then selected you for a particular role. You may perform well but a way to reduce risk altogether is by writing your character and taking at least one of the things about your work in your own hands. &nbsp;<br>It also helps in taking the edge off your acting skills. If you write yourself a character, you’ll naturally be more comfortable in doing that part since it’ll be a heavy reflection of how you actually behave in real life. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What’s the difference between writing for a streaming service or YouTube channel or your social media platform?&nbsp;</strong><br>You try to gauge the type of audience that predominantly uses the platform. Audience differs from platform to platform. TikTok has a mass audience, whereas YouTube has a combination of mass as well as an urban audience, Instagram, on the other hand, consists primarily of an urban audience. You get to know about your audience after experimenting. You fail a couple of times and get to know about it through comments. In the digital industry, you get immediate feedback now. Earlier, a movie would get released and the filmmakers would have to wait over the weekend to see what the critics have to say. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Is there a difference between filming for a streaming service, your own YouTube channel or your personal social media handle?&nbsp;</strong><br>It differs a lot on the basis of the craft. A study recently revealed that an average user watches a video on Facebook only for 3 seconds. The time frame goes down to 1 second for Instagram videos. This shows that your content needs to be very crisp, popping and attention grabbing to get the audience. This really helps you know how much work you need to put in. &nbsp;<br>It’s also very important to know that you’re working for the right platform. Suppose you’re a phenomenal writer but you might not be great at creating content for YouTube; that’s because you might write something with intricate emotional depth but YouTube’s audience isn’t interested in content like that. They’re the ones who just want to watch something at the end of the day that helps them unwind and relax. Hence, you can’t go overly emotional on YouTube. However, Netflix has an audience that has specially paid to watch content that’s different from the content on YouTube. Therefore, if a creator wants to experiment with content, he should know his platforms and the audiences that come along. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you prefer to work freelance or be associated with an organisation?&nbsp;</strong><br>Every organisation has a mandate that’s different from the other. If you’re working for a company, the mandate of your personal/work life should match with the mandate of that organisation. So, it wouldn’t matter even if you want to write the best detective story ever if your organisation simply doesn’t want it. In totality, your core values should match with the core values of the people you’re working with. That, in my opinion, is the biggest thing to find. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Seeing that you’ve worked for Little Things as well as normal shorts, which of the two is harder to execute?&nbsp;</strong><br>It’s definitely harder to make a very good 2-3 minute video than to make an average sitcom. It all depends on the intent of the creator. Many people create videos just for the sake of putting out more content; that should not be how you view your work. <i>One should always have a clear intent in mind when they’re in the process of content creation. &nbsp;</i><br><br><strong>What is it like to be a writer who’s forte is in offbeat content? What’s the journey like when you know that your content is different than what normally sells?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Your writing should reflect your essence and your personality. If it doesn’t do that, then you’ll become replaceable. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It’s the best time to be in this industry. It’s the best time to be writing because now you’re actually getting paid for it. There’s a very big luck factor attached to it. Now that you’re getting paid for it, that means you’ll be held responsible and accountable for it. <i>That’s why it’s important to not take up on projects that offer money but force you to do something that isn’t your cup of tea</i>. It’s crucial to work but to simultaneously retain your individuality during the process. Because at the end of it, your writing should reflect your essence and your personality. If it doesn’t do that, then you’ll become quite replaceable. &nbsp;<br>Everyone has different ways of achieving career fulfillment. If you feel like doing mainstream content continuously to earn enough that you can finally take a 2-year-break and work on your script, go do that. Just be happy with the direction you’re going in. Because earning money is, too, very important because you’re able to get access to better production and better people with more money. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>A couple of years ago, neither of you knew you’d be doing what you’re doing right now. All of you found your calling along the way and made your path. What are your biggest takeaways from your own journeys?&nbsp;</strong><br>My only takeaway was, \"Try first, then regret\". You must take all the chances and shots that you’re given. The regret of passing up on an opportunity and then thinking about it later is something that eats you up. Try doing as many things as you can, rather than contemplating about them later. &nbsp;<br>My takeaway revolved around Ikigai. You should try to find what you like doing and try it out. But you should also see if you’re good at it and find a method to make it financially sustainable. &nbsp;<br>I think the biggest takeaway is that you should desire to be better, while not losing your life/individuality because of your work. It’s very important to have a very healthy personal life; to love your parents, to love your friends, to be there for them and simultaneously be a good professional. This profession is too romanticised now, which it shouldn’t be. It’s a job at the end of the day. Work for those 8 hours during the day and then go live your life in a healthy manner, one in which your work doesn’t consume your entire life.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr Adarsh Nair, CEO, Wynk Limited and Chief Product Officer, Airtel, who was one of the keynote speakers in Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell, DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How would you describe your journey with Wynk and Airtel?</strong></p><p>My journey with Airtel has been a very good one. I chose to come to Airtel because India is one of the last bastions where there is a very big chance of growth happening in the next ten years. For any product manager, the dream is to be part of such a group. Also, the problems in India are very real, for example, if you look at the number of people with life insurance in this country, it is 22%, one of the lowest in the world. If you think about how people are doing transactions in this country, then you see that the penetration of digital is very small. So the problem is very real and it is a product manager’s dream to go behind such a problem. Airtel is a company where you have 300 million customers and 2000 enterprises, so it has already got a scale. Trying to sit with Airtel, and innovating with Airtel and reaching out to all these challenges in the country is a dream come true. That is how I see l progression in India and at Airtel. Wynk is one part of the problem where we are trying to solve how entertainment is delivered to the country but the larger problems which interest me are the ones around health, data, learning, education. And that is why I feel that Airtel has a huge role to play.</p><p><strong>There are a lot of international competitors in the areas that you have mentioned. What would be the role of Airtel in those sectors?</strong></p><p>We have thought a lot about it. Airtel has got four platforms which are data, network, distribution and payments. If you talk about data, we have one of the largest repositories of data in India. In innovation, we reach about 300 million people. In payments, 300 million people pay us. And we are the network, so we know the location and all those things. Any business that sits at the edge of these four will build. So we have built IoT. Advertising is another company which we should build because we have distribution and data. Anything else, we will support other companies. <i>Vahan</i> is a good example of a company which is trying to provide jobs to help the economy. So we will give our distribution and data to them and make them strong. So through partnership and our businesses, I think we can help India grow.</p><p><strong>How do you plan on solving the problem of trucks in India?</strong></p><p>If you look at <i>Rivigo</i> and <i>BlackBuck</i>, they are all companies which are trying to solve the Indian trucking problems. I do not differentiate. I rather believe in focusing on the problem. If I put the system that I built in the US in India, maximum truck drivers won’t be able to use the app which will be in English.</p><p>So you have to start looking at the problem in India. There are probably 25 languages which have come from all these different states. You have to build technology which works for them. So I don’t differentiate. I focus only on the problem and then find the solution to the problem. I always say “<i><strong>Love the problem, not the solution</strong></i>”.</p>",

Some things have improved tremendously: the infrastructure, the number of students and their happiness levels! I am really pleased by how the college has evolved. Having missed it all these years, coming back is a pleasant experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have been the President at Tech Mahindra and now you are the Chief Technology Services Officer at Sutherland Global Services, and have had a lot of leadership experience in the past as well. Do you think leadership qualities are innate or built over time?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>What really helps when you go into the corporate world is having empathy and treating people with dignity so that you get respect in return. At the same time, you must never compromise on results.</p></blockquote><p>Leadership is something you learn in college. My initial college days were a learning experience. In my college days, at DCE, one spent a lot of time doing a variety of things. I recollect that we had our own Students’ Union and I was elected. We had a lot of responsibilities, including running the festivals that would take place. The Students’ Association was one of my first places to learn and then subsequently lead.</p><p>Once, we had an all India tour via train. There were about 80 of us, and it was difficult in those days to travel so extensively. I learnt a lot of practical skills on our journey. That one trip taught me how to handle situations while having fun; and that’s where I think my instinct to lead comes from.&nbsp;</p><p>Although, what really helps when you go into the corporate world is having empathy and treating people with dignity so that you get respect in return. At the same time, you must never compromise on results. Your outcomes and results define what you can achieve but at the same time, you don’t have to be harsh. You can be demanding, but you still need to be empathetic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have handled leadership positions both in New York as well as India. What are the differences and challenges that you faced at the two places and how do you think the market at both these places differs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At the core level, people are the same. The difference comes across more in terms of cultural elements. For instance, in the formative years, as we were an evolving country with an evolving economy, people were willing to work harder. While in the West, sometimes they would be very clear about wanting to lead a balanced life. After 5 PM on Fridays, everything would shut off for the weekend. One has to learn to adjust to both of these circumstances. Although, the kind of productivity that you get from the workforce in the US is much higher. The other element is that their teams have a much wider exposure; they know how to connect the dots and tap into their creativity. You get more experienced resources in more evolved Western markets. In India, we have good coders but their skills somehow don’t translate into real life problem solving. Domain expertise also had a gap, which has narrowed down over the past few years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would you suggest the upcoming generations on how they should mitigate the knowledge and infrastructural gaps?</strong></p><blockquote><p>In today’s day and age, to say, “I was disadvantaged, so I couldn’t do it”, is not a valid argument.</p></blockquote><p>In my view, neither an infrastructural gap nor a learning gap exists. The world has become closer from a ‘learning’ point of view. It depends on how you adapt. The way you work across with it, really makes a difference. Opportunity is where you exploit it. In today’s day and age, to say, “I was disadvantaged, so I couldn’t do it”, is not a valid argument. <i>It is clear that people get opportunity if they seek one.</i> You’re getting it once you come to an institute like this. So, make the best of it and compete with the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What should the students inculcate in themselves to become a better leader or a better person to manage their corporate roles and academic roles when they grow up?</strong></p><p>One of the key elements is that you should know what you’re good at. In the past it was said that you should know your strengths and weaknesses, you must focus on your weaknesses. I believe the opposite. I believe that you should focus on your strengths because if you focus on your strengths you can do more things. I believe that working on your strengths has a cumulative effect. You already have a key strength and you can improve yourself more easily using that skill.</p><p>My kids are working, and they are off my payroll; and my clear instruction to them is to work very hard in the initial years and to make sure you earn a lot because life is going to be different. And I challenge them to earn their first million before they turn 30. It’s not the things you can do with that kind of money, but it’s the degrees of freedom you have; you can choose whatever you want to do in life. That makes a big difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, one must never stop learning. There is so much happening in the world, and there is so much to learn. Focus on your strengths and your interests. And, don’t get into a company just to get a job. If you are better at doing something consumer-oriented then focus on the consumer side of it and if you enjoy working with machines, factories and automation, then focus on that. Different people have to be good at different things and their styles of operation have to be different too. For example, someone may have a bossy working style, one could be more submissive as a person, and one could like to contribute as much as they can. But if all of these people make a team, it would be a heterogeneous team and that’s how a team should be. One must get a wider exposure to people. If we are with the same kind of people, we get similar ideas.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Ms. Jyoti Gupta, Co-founder, RankMeOnline, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What sets RankMeOnline apart from its competitors?</strong></p><p>RankMeOnline started with the focus of using AI-related solutions for businesses. There aren’t many companies in India who are doing this. It’s mainly US and European companies involved in this. Many of our counterparts have built solutions which are still manual, while we have done the same through AI. It is advantageous because first,&nbsp; I can bring down the prices as US technology or manual solutions, both will be costlier. Secondly, it helps me scale my businesses. I can approach multiple brands and get the product out. RankMeOnline sits at a base where it can cater to a lot of companies directly.</p><p><strong>As you said, not a lot of companies in India have incorporated AI. What challenges did you face when you were taking up something as novel as AI?</strong></p><p>The only challenge that I faced was getting my foot in the door and then eventually squeeze in the market. The problem was majorly getting clients because I’m from a technical background and didn’t have much access to networks or brands to get onboard. For that, I used a lot of Startup India challenges to get an idea of the corporate world where we pitched solutions to companies as something that could help their businesses. Since almost all corporates identified that our business solution works for them, they were able to use RankMeOnline in their companies. We’re still facing that problem; we haven’t completely cracked the code. We’re hiring more people in Sales - those who have more experience and can help scale the business.</p><p><strong>We’re surrounded by people pursuing engineering at DTU. What can someone, who’s inclined towards entrepreneurship and building a startup, incorporate in their lives while handling engineering at the same time?</strong></p><p>Try to make at least 6 hours a day available to you; where and how you spend these 6 hours is up to you. A lot of people spend it on watching sitcoms and playing games. You can also use your time to focus on your talent, something more than your academics. If you’re good at expressing yourself on social media, then focus on that too. It can also give you the benefit of understanding how certain communities work or how people think. Use whatever there is to improve yourself. As we can see during the E-Summit, there is already a lot of focus on startups that are excellent. So, whatever you do, do it with a passion and excel at it. You can use your 6 hours to do anything in a better, professional way, and that will also reap you benefits. You’ll be disciplined and more focused on whatever path you’ve chosen for your own growth - whether it is entrepreneurship or working in a big company.</p><p><strong>You’re from a technical background and you’ve used your technical skills to build your startup. What advice do you have for all the women pursuing a career in science and technology, which is primarily male-dominated field?</strong></p><p>I’ll tell you from my personal experience. I graduated in 2012, and I had offers from three companies- Amazon, Directi, and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The idea is to not get botched down by placements - you’ll always get placed. There will be times when it is hard for you, being the lesser part of the pie. In the very start of my professional career, there were times when meetings would go on till midnight for which I had to stayback in the office, and my parents would be very concerned about my safety. Sometimes, you’ll have to behave like a man and take your decisions upfront. You cannot play down and feel the pressure of your parents, otherwise it’ll just make your career go downhill. The other thing is that you need to be confident that you are at par with others. Let’s say that there’s an opportunity to be grabbed, and you feel that you’re not good enough for it. The other person might also be feeling the same way - it’s just a matter of who speaks up first. So, be ready for all the opportunities, be confident, and be ready to face the world. Don’t get botched down- be the person that you are.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Anubhav Tiwari, Head Outreach, Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, IIIT Hyderabad, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020 organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What basic points do you look for in an idea that can be termed as feasible for a startup?</strong></p><p>The idea should be big enough to cater to the problems that exist. The ideology that ‘my college is facing this problem, so I should build this product’ is wrong. Since your college is not accurate market size, you will have to see whether that problem is actually being faced by the masses. Any potential idea should be the solution to a problem being faced by the masses. That’s when you have the potential to scale.</p><p><strong>Over the past few years, startups have shifted from product-based business to service-based business. What could be the reason for that?</strong></p><p>The shift is different in different geographies. If you consider the case of Hyderabad, for example, in the early 90s product-based companies were more but by the late 90s, there was a considerable rise in service-based companies. However, after 2007, there was a shift again in favour of product-based companies. To be fair, we cannot make a general comment about this shift as scenarios everywhere are different. If you ask me, though, as someone who has been in and around the ecosystem for several years now, I'd say the transition is more towards the product side, that is, people are shifting to product-based companies rather than service-based ones.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think the use of Artificial Intelligence in startups today is a beneficial step?</strong></p><p>AI is the future and it is catching up. If you're building something around AI, you're being futuristic since it will cover most of the operational aspects of your company sooner or later. Everything is based on data nowadays and it depends on you that how you convert that data into information, information into insights and the insights into decisions. If this process involves fewer humans and more unbiased algorithms, the results will surely be better.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ask me how the trend was during the ’90s, I would say that it was the IT boom. Right now, it’s the AI boom.</p><p><strong>How does an entrepreneur's experience different if he pitches directly to a venture capitalist, rather than approaching an incubator first?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"Why can't I sit for Boards right now, without going to school?\"</p></blockquote><p>VC comes into the picture at a much later stage. When you go to an incubator first, you get a lot of help at the initial stage. It is like a first grader asking the question \"Why can't I sit for Boards right now, without going to school?\" There is a reason why schools and other academic institutions exist and there's a reason why we go to them. You can say you'll get the books, take home tuitions, won't go to school and still learn. Of course, you will learn but the institutions provide a structure to the learning process and you will miss out on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting into an incubation centre is good as you get to learn from the mistakes of others and know exactly what to avoid. You can get some very critical strategic help at early stages. Plus, you get the infrastructure support so you don't have to worry about the services you require when building the company. Once you get an incubator's tag on you, it becomes the responsibility of the incubator to bring investors for you.</p><p><strong>What, according to you, is a better step for entrepreneurs - to do a startup as a fresher or after 5-6 years of industry experience?</strong></p><p>The industry experience disciplines you, teaches you how to work with a team, and also gives you the domain knowledge of the industry. When working on a startup, you don’t have anyone to tell you about right or wrong, and you aren’t mature enough to take such decisions right after college. So a few years of working under someone in the corporate world actually gives you a disciplined and organized way of running projects. Ultimately, a startup is also a project - a pretty big one! So if you are disciplined enough, know team cohesiveness, know how to build it and take it forward, it definitely adds on.&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn’t mean that if you don’t have this experience, you won’t be successful. There are many good stories involving people who haven’t worked anywhere and are successfully running startups. But it’s always a standard practice to work prior to running a startup. It’s like saying that people have qualified for UPSC without going for coaching. Well, how many do? Very few.</p><p><strong>Does age become a barrier for entrepreneurs, given that the willingness to take risks is generally varying?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Age is just a number!</p></blockquote><p>No, it’s not like that. PUBG was developed by a 62-year-old photographer, not even a game developer. So, age is just a number.</p><p>The problem is not age, it’s the liabilities one has to take care of. If you have to take care of education loans or some other liabilities, it will stop you from taking risks. If you have a family to look after, you won’t put everything at stake for a start-up. So, it’s the liabilities that stop you, not the age.</p><p><strong>What final message would you give to the students planning to venture into entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>Yes. Before you start, please use Google first. It’s the simplest and easiest thing that everybody avoids, but it eventually matters. You need to understand your market, you need to do a lot of research, and you need to build things that people need, not what you think people need.</p>",

    "body": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Failure as a topic was often touched upon in the discussion today. You mentioned that you failed in your college exams ten-fifteen years ago. How have the challenges changed over a span of fifteen years? Do you still feel dejected when you fail, or do you just view failure as an opportunity?</strong></p><p>There are two parts to your question. I’ll answer the latter first. I look at failure the same way as I did fifteen years ago. It’s how you keep evolving your mental setup that counts. One thing is for sure, more opportunities are bound to come. Don’t get me wrong, I fail now as well- but over time I’ve learnt to incorporate my past expertise to overcome the challenges presented to me. I often say ‘This too shall pass’ since it has already occurred and I was able to overcome it then hence, I’ll be able to overcome it now.</p><p>As for the former question, things have changed dramatically over the past fifteen years. Every five years, there is a generation change. I’m talking about the time when I had Nokia 3315 and today the scenario is completely different. Opportunities are limitless. You get many more options now, the avenues are much wider. You can do a lot of things and know about a lot of things. Back then we were stuck with a few options and were not aware how others were looking at them due to restricted flow of information, but it isn’t the same anymore. Problem solving has a whole different array of options to choose from. Instead of the emphasis being on success, like it was twenty years back, today it is okay to fail. Spanning from sports teams to world leaders, failure is acceptable. So, that acceptance of failure and the presence of alternate avenues has changed.</p><p><strong>With the huge influx of students into the area of entrepreneurship, what would you say are a few red flags they should be aware of?</strong></p><p>Don’t just follow the rat race, don’t do it because others are. I said one thing very prominently in my speech earlier, that is there is a marked difference between an idea and intellectual property. You can have a great idea but till the time it converts into an intellectual property, in terms of becoming a business unit or revenue generating model, you are still just maybe playing with fire and hoping against hope. So, it’s important for you to be wary of the fact that a great idea is great but if you don’t have a plan to convert it into an intellectual property, then you are stepping into uncharted territory where you’re bound to encounter many pitfalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I think you should always have a Plan B in your mind, because there’ll be obstacles. When I talk about Plan B, I’m not talking about an escape plan, I’m talking about how and what you’ll do if a certain aspect of your plan doesn’t pan out as you wanted it to,. Also, be very well versed or aware of your competition. Know your competition. Nokia failed because it was never able to cope up with the evolution around. Hence, it’s important for you to have alternate options available, concrete plans to convert your idea into an intellectual property and to remain aware about the changing trends.</p><p><strong>You have talked extensively about ‘</strong><i><strong>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</strong></i><strong>’, a very successful book written by Carol Dweck. So, what would you say are the books which will help budding entrepreneurs develop and eventually achieve success?</strong></p><p>At the moment, I can only think of this book. But I think they should focus on learning more about people who have succeeded and more importantly, they should read about people who have succeeded in recent times. What worked earlier may not be working today but the ground rules and the structure remains the same. The way you deal with people in a certain situation does not change. If you read about people who have succeeded now, you’ll realise that there are some absolute mavericks who have changed the world. Conditioning your mind that it has worked for other people and it will work for me too, is essential. To realise your potential books are great but practical knowledge is essential and can’t be avoided. You can’t master cricket without playing it on the field. Practical knowledge is something that you must focus more on, rather than the theory. Theory is necessary to have some perspective but implementing it and practising it with experienced people is imperative for growth.</p><p><strong>You said that there’s a generation change every five years. Do you think it aggrandises the situation concerning the Indian market, which is already a tough nut to crack, for new companies who are trying to thrive in it?</strong></p><p>I would like to look at it more positively. There’s more opportunity in a market like India because it is still not highly developed, and it is still not struggling in terms of basic infrastructure. There is a push by the government too and you also have NGO’s. There’s an emphasis on crowdfunding as well. I don’t think a changing environment is a challenge, I think it’s an opportunity for you to see your ideas turn into intellectual property. Regarding the frequent changes in the way generations think, again, I would like to look at it as an opportunity for you to keep yourself fresh and new.</p><p><strong>You mention that one of the key things that you look for in a candidate is the attitude they bring to the table. So, what are the characteristics you look for in a candidate?</strong></p><p>I think passion is the word. If you’re passionate and if it comes across, then it sets the tone for you to be successful in whatever field you want. If you’re not good at something, you will get better at it if you keep working on it. Most successful people on this planet are people who have been extremely passionate. If it’s an idea that you want to turn into success, you must be absolutely hawk-eyed with blinkers. The gravitational pull of that passion will make sure that you keep evolving. For me, passion is paramount, and everything boils down to that. You gain more knowledge if you’re passionate. If you’re passionate about leaving an impression, then you’ll make sure that you invest in your subject matter expertise as well. If you’re passionate about clearing your interview, then you will do your research on it, you will talk to people who have cleared it in the past. That research, that growth mindset, all of it will follow if you have passion in the first place.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Atul Tiwari, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>With so much talk going on about entrepreneurship, do you think that today’s fresh graduates are not as inclined towards securing a job as their predecessors?</strong></p><p>I do feel that because nowadays there are a lot of avenues that people are aware of and they definitely want to explore something non-conventional, unlike what it used to be earlier. People really know what the problems at hand are and how they can be solved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>People often are reluctant to switch from a cushy job in a big firm to becoming a part of a startup. What are some of the aspects that one must keep in mind while deciding if or not they should switch?</strong></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;You could have a great idea, a great thought process and a solution to a great problem but if you don’t have the right ecosystem, then it is all in vain.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It all depends on how you as an individual are, what your needs are and what kind of an ecosystem you have. You could have a great idea, a great thought process and a solution to a great problem but if you don’t have the right ecosystem, then it is all in vain. An ecosystem- it includes you as an individual, your mindset, your thought process and other aspects like funding and the sustainability of a particular idea- is something which definitely helps you. Otherwise if you see, it is always safer at times to get a job, identify the nuances, and then go for something typically more aspirational. Nevertheless, you might face some new problems altogether. But still, it is better to have a known devil than an unknown one. It is also alright if one decides to go for a startup without securing a job first.</p><p><strong>What was the one thing which helped you transition into such starkly different roles in different companies?</strong></p><p>Be fluid like water. Having an open mindset is also very important. Do not have preconceived notions and water-tight compartments in your mind about what you want to do and be stuck to it. Always remember that what you are doing is not only for your professional growth but also for you as an individual; it defines your personality, which gives you freedom, satisfaction, and a sense of success. It is very important to realise that what took you to one position may not take you to another. Now you need to reap something differently to reach another level. You need to develop agility with respect to changing roles and the different expectations which come with them.</p><p><strong>You mentioned earlier in your talk that when you were starting out, you would have preferred a corporate role to a business role. Why was that?</strong></p><p>This was a preconceived notion of mine. I thought that it was the safest path at that point of time. But when I was given a business role, it gave me a different perspective altogether about the organisation- how it works, its vision, and the realisation that I could contribute in a much better way here than in a corporate role. I don’t mean to say that a corporate role does not provide you with the same kind of visibility, but it provides you with limited visibility. When you are in a business (role), you know what you are into. It also allows you to apply what you have learnt and your experiences. You also find a context to deal with a problem and a vision that you have to attain. Hence, I was fortunate to have been pushed into a business role and get the opportunities to learn.</p><p><strong>You talked about how one of the characteristics of a good entrepreneur is in how he handles chaos and ambiguity. What are some other important traits?</strong></p><p>Chaos and ambiguity are constants. One very important thing is capacity, both in terms of skill set and patience. Even if you are faced with a very difficult situation, you must not get bogged down by it, distressed by it or deviated from your vision. So, capacity does define one of the major traits of an ideal entrepreneur or a part of an entrepreneurial organization.</p><p><strong>Are long stints at firms still as fruitful as they used to be as far as career progression is concerned?</strong></p><p>I think the tenure does not matter, rather what value you add to the organisation and what value you get from the organisation are what matter. Tenure, be it of one year or ten years, does not matter. Till the time you do not get the feeling that you have contributed whatever you could to the organisation, you should continue with the work. But you must also consider the opportunities and the values that you are getting from the organisation. If both the parameters are being met, then the number of years don’t matter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why do you say that people who have failed as entrepreneurs can do well in corporate jobs?</strong></p><p>That is not always the case but this is what seems to be the trend now. They seem to have the guts to take initiative, and they have experimented because of which they have developed creativity, which is important since nowadays mundane things do not work. Hence, employers will go for such people who can do something new since that is the need of the hour. Entrepreneurs also have risk-taking ability and capacity. They have also experienced hardships, which is why they do not have a rosy picture of the organisation painted in their minds. They seem to have more hunger and fire in them, which is required and expected nowadays. So, even hundred-year-old corporations need such people to change the wheels. They act as catalysts in bringing about change.</p><p><strong>How do you think that the startup culture has changed over the years?</strong></p><p>It has not changed a lot since it has just started but there are a few changes in terms of how they are approaching- they are more conscious about the problem that they are tackling and are now keeping users at the center rather than the solution to the problem. There are two things: the destination and the journey. Now, the journey is something that startups are focusing on. They are focusing on what kind of journey the users are experiencing while using the product. That is very important.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Rajesh Das, CEO, Founder of InLog, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Start-ups are not very popular amongst students. How do you think that we can teach students that this risk is worth taking?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, every university should start an incubator. A lot of collaborative work with the huge DTU alumni network also needs to be done. For reaching out to students who are more academically inclined, courses related to startups should be introduced.&nbsp; Lack of knowledge agitates people; one may have an idea but not the proper skillset to execute it.</p><p><strong>Do you think the DCE/DTU nostalgia still exists? Do the people consider DCE better than DTU?</strong></p><p>People do have a tendency to think that 'their' time was better. However, I feel that today's environment is extremely different and needs to be appreciated in its own way.</p><p><strong>How do you think the startup culture has changed over the years?</strong></p><p>People have seen the opportunities in this sector only recently.&nbsp; We now explore ourselves more as individuals. Earlier, people were organisation dependent but now, they are more open towards starting their own companies and being entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>How can the quality of startups improve?</strong></p><p>Newer ideas need to come in the picture. As of now, there is a shortage of ideas. The quality of ideas is a latter concern.</p><p><strong>How do you think E-summit helps to change the mindset of the students?</strong></p><p>Students can now seek inspiration from live examples, 'the Doers'. The hesitation of taking the first step has vanished. The incubation center can play a huge role in changing mindsets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the challenges faced while building a startup?</strong></p><p>Shortage of money is one problem. While exploring one's ideas, it becomes difficult to look for venture capitalists. There is a shortage of availability of seed funds as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your advice for students who would like to venture in the entrepreneurship field?</strong></p><p>Search for yourself.&nbsp; We need to understand that the world is changing and&nbsp; there is an ecological division. People need to connect, understand the purpose and relate with your ideas.</p><p><strong>How do you think people can pursue their calling, if it's too late to start?</strong></p><p>It is never too late to start. It is a journey. You can always change your career, all you need to do is explore and find your passion and develop it. The fear of failure needs to go away. We need to attach to ourselves by spending more time with nature.&nbsp; Most CEOs always try to find peace in nature and get into the process of self realization. One should start thinking and connecting with the sources in our vicinity.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Rajiv Juneja, Co-founder and Director of Projects, Reliable Business Management Support Systems, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>You mentioned that you had been in a job for forty years before you began your own venture. Why motivated you to do so and what does your new job entail?</strong></p><p>I switched to consultancy because after my superannuation, I wanted to engage myself, to keep myself active, so I started a small venture of my own – a reliable businessmen support system. We support sick units – people who are doing very good but somehow, due to operational problems or market conditions or any other reason, they went into loss. We try to restore their health. We try to improve their profitability and help them increase their avenues so that they can garner more market share. It’s going well. As a matter of chance, when we were doing all this, one of the team members came forward and said that they wanted to have one more vertical. So, we are now supporting e-vehicles as well. However, the investments involved in it are huge, so we will not be able to invest but we can support them. We can tell them about the best technology available and how they can adopt those technologies. How, in the future, we can build those products here in India because sometimes it pinches me that, as engineering graduates, we are not able to give back that much. When we graduated, the difference between India and China was not that great but now there is such a huge gap. I don’t how we can plug that gap. Anyway, let’s forget about that, bad memories. You shouldn’t keep them with yourself <i>(laughs)</i>. So, now we need to put in our best. We are now supporting some businesses and their e-vehicle ventures.</p><p><strong>The current start-ups in the Indian market follow a certain trend, like we have a lot of e-commerce websites. What do you want to see changing in the current start-up scenario?</strong></p><p>Nowadays, we have all started repeating, more or less. We have come to a stage where we see Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato and UrbanClap. There is a lot of repetition now which leads to pointless competition amongst us. The manufacturing sector, however, has a lot of wiggle room. We are not utilising our engineering skills where, again, China is much far ahead. Sometimes, it really pains me that any device I pick in my house has ‘Made in China’ written on it and that’s not good so we need to catch up on the manufacturing sector now. Swiggy, Zomato, Paytm will all have a lot of competition among them. A lot of MNCs will come and they would like us to compete and ultimately, we’ll hand over our businesses to them. So, the next ten years must be utilised for the manufacturing sector because USA, Europe and all the countries of the world want to exit China, they have given enough indicators. But we are not coming forward. When we go to China, we literally develop a complex that we will not be able to reach this level. So that complex needs to be resolved and we must focus on manufacturing because otherwise, giving employment to such a large population is not possible. Swiggy is giving employment to a delivery man but I have seen engineers delivering food. So, I think that we need to focus more on the manufacturing sector. The service sector is good and very safe – lesser profits, lesser loss but still, manufacturing sector is much better so we must focus on that. We need to give a good challenge. Please tell the authorities in your college to focus more on the manufacturing sector as a part of the curriculum. You must have seen the people in ‘Excel Technologies’ and that is a very good idea that needs to be promoted.</p><p><strong>You were talking about the competition between India and China. So, sometimes it becomes very difficult for small ventures to survive or to thrive in this environment. So how do you think these small business ventures can cope?</strong></p><p>We must follow China’s model. When China was starting some fifty-sixty years back, where we are today, they were taking technologies from Japan, Europe or some other country. They mastered those technologies to such an extent, that the best mobile and laptop companies come from there at one-third the price at which they are sold to us. That means that there is a lot of room in between. An I-phone priced at $3,000 is sold at $700 so there is a lot of room in between. And it is not a very competitive market so we can replace them. The US and Europe both want that. We have to come forward now, we have to say, “We are ready to invest”. Now, the problem is that there are a lot of funds available in the market, that can be invested, provided that strong teams are there that are able to convince them that these ventures are profitable. All these corporates are literally sitting on money. They have a lot of profit coming in and they are sitting on a lot of money which they can invest. All we must do is convince them that we can compete with China. If they are convinced, it is done.</p><p><strong>What measures do you think that the manufacturing sector can take to improve?</strong></p><p>There is a problem with our business sector, overall. They have been family-centric and the business or the industries are handed over from families to the nearest one. New talent used to go there but they are not able to retain that talent with them for a long time. So, we need to have more professionalism. We must infuse professionalism into the family run businesses. You may still have executive chairman; you can have managing directors, but family run businesses should not provide employment only to the family members but must do something else. They must do that because the time has come now. They must place economic intelligence above the interest of the family and that is how we can progress. Otherwise, it is the same old story. We have a lot of expectations from the new generation, on this count.</p><p><strong>A lot of questions have been raised about the employability of engineering graduates, in general. So, do you think that it affects the jobs that they take up and the start-up culture in general?</strong></p><p>Starting a start-up means employing yourself. I don’t find any difference between giving employment to yourself and generating employment for other people. So, that should not hold us back. We must choose any path wherein we are able to use our engineering. Everyone runs after IIM and FMS. So, that makes us forget a lot of things about engineering. Even the youngsters in my own family after graduating from IIM want to forget engineering and this is bad because the institute spent so much on them. It is another form of brain drain and that’s where we need to do something. Maybe, we can go for specialization after B.Tech.. Research is one area where we must invest our resources and engineering graduates are the optimal candidates for that. It may take a while to pay you, but when you finally receive payment, it will be worth it. One good research idea and you’re in luck. This is what we need to do.</p><p><strong>Often, many students leave the country and go to US or any other country because they complain that the research infrastructure in India is lacking and this leads to brain drain. What are your thoughts on this matter?</strong></p><p>Yes, brain drain is real but then there are people like Narayan Murthy. They are running incubators. It all depends on how we think. There are a lot of small organizations doing research. So, there are good examples but going to US is the easier option. The problem is the way our country is manipulated. In the US, majority of the kids drop out after twelfth grade. They are happy working in McDonalds or something like that. They are not born rich, so they need talent and they are utilising us. Students of DTU and IITs rush to US and if not the US, then Canada or Australia or even UK. Now, Europe is providing opportunities as well because these countries have a small knowledge base and they want us. People can still come back; it depends on them. However, they will only come back if they find the infrastructure here comparable to what those countries have. At some point, we hope that they will return and help. I agree that, fifteen-twenty years back, opportunities in the country were not that great, but today they are. Earlier, one had to struggle to get gas cylinders and open bank accounts, but today, that is not the case. Things have changed a lot. The level of transparency has increased, and the tax department doesn’t trouble you anymore <i>(laughs)</i>.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Harsh Sawnani, Talent Acquisition Leader, Deloitte, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020 organised by E-Cell DTU.</i></p><p><strong>What are some characteristics you look for in a job candidate?</strong></p><p>I think <i>passion</i> is the word. For me, passion is paramount, and everything boils down to that. If you come across as passionate, it sets the tone for you to be successful in whichever field you want to pursue. If you’re not good at something, you will get better at it if you keep working on it. Most successful people on this planet are people who have been extremely passionate. If it’s an idea that you want to turn into success, you must be absolutely hawk-eyed with blinkers. The gravitational pull of that passion will make sure that you keep evolving. You gain more knowledge if you’re passionate. If you’re passionate about leaving an impression, then you’ll make sure that you invest in your subject matter expertise as well. If you’re passionate about clearing your interview, then you will do your research on it, you will talk to people who have cleared it in the past. That research, that growth mindset, all of it will follow if you have passion in the first place.</p><p><strong>The topic of failure was often touched upon in the discussion today. You mentioned that you failed in your college exams 10-15 years ago. How have the challenges changed over a span of fifteen years? Do you still feel dejected when you fail, or do you view failure as an opportunity?</strong></p><p>I was talking about the time when I had a Nokia 3315, and today the scenario is completely different. Things have changed dramatically over the last fifteen years, since every five years, there is a generation change. Now, opportunities and options are limitless. Back then, we were stuck with a few options and were not aware of how others were looking at them due to the restricted flow of information, but it isn’t the same anymore. Problem solving has a whole different array of options to choose from. Instead of the emphasis being on success, like it was twenty years ago, today, failure is acceptable. So, that acceptance of failure and the presence of alternate avenues has changed.</p><p>I look at failure the same way as I did fifteen years ago. It’s how you keep evolving your mental setup that counts. One thing is for sure, more opportunities are bound to come. Don’t get me wrong, I fail now as well, but over time I’ve learnt to incorporate my past expertise to overcome the challenges presented to me. I often say ‘this too shall pass', since it has already occurred and I was able to overcome it then; hence, I’ll be able to overcome it now.</p><p><strong>What would you say are a few red flags that students venturing into entrepreneurship should be aware of?</strong></p><p>Don’t just follow the rat race, and don’t do something just because others are doing it. There is a marked difference between an idea and intellectual property. You can have a great idea, but till the time it converts into intellectual property, in terms of becoming a business unit or a revenue generating model, you are still just maybe playing with fire and hoping against hope. It’s important to be wary of the fact that a great idea is great, but if you don’t have a plan to convert it into intellectual property, then you are stepping into uncharted territory where you’re bound to encounter many pitfalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I think that you should always have a Plan B in your mind, because there’ll be obstacles. When I talk about Plan B, I’m not talking about an escape plan, I’m talking about how and what you’ll do if a certain aspect of your plan doesn’t pan out as you wanted it to. Also, know your competition. Nokia failed because it was never able to cope with the evolution happening all around. Hence, it’s important for you to have alternate options available, concrete plans to convert your idea into intellectual property, and awareness about the changing trends.</p><p><strong>You have talked extensively about ‘</strong><i><strong>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</strong></i><strong>’, a very successful book written by Carol Dweck. What would you say are the books which will help budding entrepreneurs develop and eventually achieve success?</strong></p><p>At the moment, I can only think of this book. I think budding entrepreneurs should focus on learning more about people who have succeeded, and more importantly, they should read about people who have succeeded in recent times. What worked earlier may not work today, but the ground rules and the structure remain the same. The way you deal with people in a certain situation does not change. If you read about people who have succeeded now, you’ll realise that there are some absolute mavericks who have changed the world. Conditioning your mind to think 'it has worked for other people and it will work for me too' is essential. To realise your potential, books are great, but practical knowledge is essential and can’t be avoided. You can’t master cricket without playing it on the field. Practical knowledge is something that you must focus more on, rather than the theory. Theory is necessary to have some perspective, but implementing it and practising it with experienced people is imperative for growth.</p><p><strong>You said that there’s a generation change every five years. Do you think it aggrandises the situation concerning the Indian market, which is already a tough nut to crack, for new companies who are trying to thrive in it?</strong></p><p>I would like to look at it more positively. There are more opportunities in a market like India because it is still not highly developed, yet it is not struggling in terms of basic infrastructure. There is a push by the government too, there are NGOs, and there’s an emphasis on crowdfunding as well. I don’t think a changing environment is a challenge, I think it’s an opportunity for you to see your ideas turn into intellectual property. Regarding the frequent changes in the way generations think, again, I would like to look at it as an opportunity for you to keep yourself fresh and new.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Rajesh Das, CEO and Founder, InLog, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Startups are not very popular amongst students and there is a lot of inertia against the startup culture. How do you think that we can inculcate in the students that the startup risk is worth taking?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, every university should start an incubator. A lot of collaborative work with the huge DTU alumni network needs to be done as well. I am not aware of the current course structure, but for reaching out to students who are more academically inclined, courses related to startups and entrepreneurship should be introduced too.&nbsp;Most of the times lack of knowledge also agitates people; one may have an idea but not the proper skill set to execute it. An incubator centre can definitely help nourishing that skill set.</p><p><strong>Talking about the startup culture in India, how do you think it has evolved over the years?</strong></p><p>People have seen the opportunities in this sector only recently&nbsp;as earlier the availability and access to the resources was also less. Today, there is a realisation that we can explore ourselves more as individuals and can help resolve the issues around us. Earlier, people would depend on an organisation to implement our ideas. But today with that realisation, I as an individual, with the help of my colleagues and friends can innovate things around us ourselves. We have become more open towards starting our own companies and becoming entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>Given the current startup scenario, what do you think is lacking in terms of the ideas or approaches and how can the quality of startups improve?</strong></p><p>Firstly, the number of people with ideas needs to increase. Once we have a sufficient number of ideas, we can always develop a collaborative approach to build around that idea. If there is a dearth of ideas at the university level, the Alumni wouldn't be able to do much either. Once we have newer ideas in our frame, the Alumni can help a select few of them to grow. The quality of ideas is a latter concern.</p><p>Also, with more Entrepreneurship Summits like this, people see more success stories and students can now seek inspiration from those stories. The hesitation of taking the first step will thus vanish. The incubation centre can also play a huge role in changing mindsets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are some of the challenges one must be prepared for before starting a startup?</strong></p><p>I believe that the challenges one faces can be on two levels: the challenges during the exploration of the idea. A shortage of money can be one of the problems. While exploring one's ideas, it becomes difficult to look for venture capitalists. Incubation centres play a really important role in this as most often than now, there is a shortage of availability of seed funds as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think people can pursue their calling, if it's too late to start?</strong></p><p>It is never too late to start. Finding your purpose is a journey in itself. Once you start that journey, you can redefine your purpose. You can always change your career, all you need to do is explore and find your passion and develop it. This can only happen once you start believing in yourself. The fear of failure or not doing well needs to go away.</p><p><strong>What is your advice for students who would like to venture into the entrepreneurship field?</strong></p><p>Search for self.&nbsp; We really need to understand that the world is changing and&nbsp;there is an ecological division, social division, and self-division. &nbsp;People need to connect with each other, understand their purpose and relate with their ideas.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Ashish Mediratta, Head, Global Talent Acquisition, Tata Communications, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Today's talk revolved a lot around the definition of an ideal entrepreneur. What would your description of an ideal entrepreneur be?</strong></p><p>It is imperative to know your domain, to surround yourself with relevant people, to have that vision to convince others, and to have that will and resilience to absorb pressure, work hard, and not take a no for an answer while taking failures in your stride. You will be hit by challenges everyday, but that is something that happens to all of us in the corporate world as well. Even when students are working on their projects, they face challenges. However students here are in this university, because they have proven their worth to be in the finest colleges in India. There is no iota of doubt in my mind that if they go after anything in life, they can easily crack it.</p><p>Also, when you look at highly successful people such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, their personalities have something special about them. However, could these people have been successful without teamwork? It is important to know in which areas you are not a specialist and get those relevant people around you to guide you. While you have the instinct of being a leader, you would also need to have the skills of teamwork and cooperation.</p><p><strong>You were talking about how AI is making great strides in the recruitment and the overall hiring procedures. How do you think this changes the dynamics of the traditional hiring procedure?</strong></p><p>There are a long list of changes: for example the way your profiles will be read by corporate companies will be heavily influenced by your social media. The way you come across from LinkedIn or Facebook will allow them to know more about you, what kind of activities you are involved in, your likes and dislikes, projects or initiatives. For example, GitHub today is a very important channel for the IT industry. People rate you amongst many others. This is a small part of a public profile, which is not present in your CV and I, as an interviewer, would get to know more about you. Everyone on campus has a standard 1 page CV, so which is your special trait that is not known in the CV?&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, technology will evolve so much, for example if someone was looking at a particular skill and notices that a firm needs someone well versed in it, AI will soon be proficient enough to tell us the gap between skills, how much time it will take people to cross the gap and learn that new skill. It helps us in retention of talent, removing the need to hire from outside. In the corporate world today, there is a big HR conundrum, whether one should hire from outside or, look for growing talent internally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A lot of critics have argued that although AI will reduce the human effort during recruitment, it can also be biased and never at par with the quality traits that a human assesses during a one-on-one interview. How do you think we circumvent this problem?</strong></p><p>I believe that the inherent question here is, who is the one training this AI? The answer is, humans. Are we implying that humans are not biased? We often encounter racism during an interview, and other interview panelists who are biased, and hence, we shouldn’t be blaming AI for its shortcomings. Artificial Intelligence will learn, through mistakes or through people who are going to help solve those bugs. However, the bugs in the human mind can be equally difficult to squash.</p><p><strong>AI can sort profiles based on the candidates’ technical qualifications or based on who they are. However in a one-on-one interview format, we can gauge their emotional aspect as well, which is essential apart from their other quality traits. Can AI aim achieve this feat?</strong></p><blockquote><p>AI is here to assist, not to replace.</p></blockquote><p>This is something AI can’t do, at least today. Currently, what AI does is, to break jobs into skills and their requirements, and it also looks at CVs to turn those into skills. If you have had success throughout your career, it will reflect: AI will match those skills through the CV to base its recommendation. An AI program will only look at, say, 100 profiles and recommend the top 5 of them, that is where human intervention comes in, so that I don’t need to look at a 100 resumes to hire those two people, going through those selected five to hire the two candidates is what I care about. AI is here to assist, not to replace.</p><p><strong>Apart from talent acquisition, what are some other applications of AI and ML?</strong></p><p>I’d say the most relevant application is in the learning and development areas. AI can, through the gaps of your skills, judge your learning ability - how fast you can learn. It can notify me about the average learning rate, compared with mine, and thus posing a question - do I want to stick in this career, or where is it that my talents are most suited? These things will start solving issues for future talent management, learning and development, and eventually all these areas will start getting closer together.</p><p><strong>How do you think the startup culture has changed over the years?</strong></p><blockquote><p>You need to have the resilience to work 16 hours a day to keep your startup afloat.</p></blockquote><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, there are fewer jobs available outside, leaving not many choices out there either. The amount of inertia that used to earlier exist against startups has turned itself in the favour of startups. Therefore, we have quite a few firms looking to fund promising startups. Being an entrepreneur, you also have to figure out other parts and challenges that you will face. You need to have the resilience to work 16 hours a day to keep your startup afloat, but do you have the resources and the right people around you to make it a success? All said and done, it’s a terrific time to start a startup.</p><p><strong>Given the booming startup scenario in India, are the fresh graduates of this generation as inclined towards landing a job as compared to their predecessors?</strong></p><p>If you compare people pursuing degrees like MBA to people willing to land government jobs, they sit on two opposite ends of a spectrum. Some people are MBAs and doctors but still crack the UPSC and get into government jobs. This conundrum exists in everybody’s life. You have to, first of all, discover a little bit about yourself. After that, you can take a call, keeping in mind where you see yourself. The options will always be in front of you, which path you take is up to you to decide, and once you do, you should just stick to it.</p><p><strong>Some people often believe that they have spent a very long time to figure out what they want to do further in life or what their true calling is, that when they wish to finally pursue it, the age barrier hinders them from doing so. How do you beat this kind of mindset in people?</strong></p><p>Beyond a point you don’t have to beat that mindset out of people. Self-doubts are going to remain anyways. At the end of the day, as long as you know your calling in life, that is extremely important. If you follow your passion, you will do extremely well in life.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, my 23-year-old nephew happens to be a music lover, and he is solely committed towards it and towards the number of challenges he has seen, be it labour problems or quality assurance. Putting in 16 hours per day, almost 7 hours a week shows the immense dedication he has towards his passion. I believe that is the kind of commitment required to be successful and in the end, it’s all about your attitude and will.</p><p><strong>In following their passion, people often end up working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, as you mentioned. Do you think this is the prime reason which leads to burnouts amongst youth?</strong></p><p>Definitely. Why would one want to be saddled with say, an MBA and take up a job offer when you have the potential to scale up your business or even make it global, something people yearn for?&nbsp;</p><p>If one has worked relentlessly to establish himself and now that one has achieved some degree of success, one should keep on working for it. Obviously, 16 hours a day is not sustainable, so one should know where to draw the line. I would suggest to add more people around you so that you can delegate your work and you do not have to work so hard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think the research infrastructure at the university level aids in building the entrepreneurial mindset in the students?</strong></p><p>I think research infrastructure is one part of what you require, the other thing is getting into those projects which will impart you the learning. Today, we have programs for skill development, etc., but what is missing today is their practical experience. If I hire from outside, how will the internal assets grow? Therefore, we at Tata Communications have built a project marketplace. If I, as a manager, have a certain project where I want employees to work on it in their free time, we put that in the marketplace where employees can apply for it and we can select them for the same, giving them the precious hands-on experience for those products. It is the practical exposure of these skills that will set you apart. Surely, you may not have an experience of more than a few months, but what you have shown through this exercise is a drive to take initiative and showing interest in a particular skill, which I believe is extremely crucial.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Anubhav Tiwari, Head - Incubation &amp; Corporate Innovation, Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, IIIT Hyderabad, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020 organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What basic points do you look for in an idea that can be termed as feasible for a startup?</strong></p><p>The idea should be big enough to cater to the problems that exist. The ideology that ‘my college is facing this problem, so I should build this product’ is wrong. Since your college is not accurate market size, you will have to see whether that problem is actually being faced by the masses. Any potential idea should be the solution to a problem being faced by the masses. That’s when you have the potential to scale.</p><p><strong>Over the past few years, startups have shifted from product-based business to service-based business. What could be the reason for that?</strong></p><p>The shift is different in different geographies. If you consider the case of Hyderabad, for example, in the early 90s product-based companies were more but by the late 90s, there was a considerable rise in service-based companies. However, after 2007, there was a shift again in favour of product-based companies. To be fair, we cannot make a general comment about this shift as scenarios everywhere are different. If you ask me, though, as someone who has been in and around the ecosystem for several years now, I'd say the transition is more towards the product side, that is, people are shifting to product-based companies rather than service-based ones.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think the use of Artificial Intelligence in startups today is a beneficial step?</strong></p><p>AI is the future and it is catching up. If you're building something around AI, you're being futuristic since it will cover most of the operational aspects of your company sooner or later. Everything is based on data nowadays and it depends on you that how you convert that data into information, information into insights and the insights into decisions. If this process involves fewer humans and more unbiased algorithms, the results will surely be better.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ask me how the trend was during the ’90s, I would say that it was the IT boom. Right now, it’s the AI boom.</p><p><strong>How does an entrepreneur's experience different if he pitches directly to a venture capitalist, rather than approaching an incubator first?</strong></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Why can't I sit for Boards right now, without going to school?\"</i></p></blockquote><p>VC comes into the picture at a much later stage. When you go to an incubator first, you get a lot of help at the initial stage. It is like a first grader asking the question \"Why can't I sit for Boards right now, without going to school?\" There is a reason why schools and other academic institutions exist and there's a reason why we go to them. You can say you'll get the books, take home tuitions, won't go to school and still learn. Of course, you will learn but the institutions provide a structure to the learning process and you will miss out on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting into an incubation centre is good as you get to learn from the mistakes of others and know exactly what to avoid. You can get some very critical strategic help at early stages. Plus, you get the infrastructure support so you don't have to worry about the services you require when building the company. Once you get an incubator's tag on you, it becomes the responsibility of the incubator to bring investors for you.</p><p><strong>What, according to you, is a better step for entrepreneurs - to do a startup as a fresher or after 5-6 years of industry experience?</strong></p><p>The industry experience disciplines you, teaches you how to work with a team, and also gives you the domain knowledge of the industry. When working on a startup, you don’t have anyone to tell you about right or wrong, and you aren’t mature enough to take such decisions right after college. So a few years of working under someone in the corporate world actually gives you a disciplined and organized way of running projects. Ultimately, a startup is also a project - a pretty big one! So if you are disciplined enough, know team cohesiveness, know how to build it and take it forward, it definitely adds on.&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn’t mean that if you don’t have this experience, you won’t be successful. There are many good stories involving people who haven’t worked anywhere and are successfully running startups. But it’s always a standard practice to work prior to running a startup. It’s like saying that people have qualified for UPSC without going for coaching. Well, how many do? Very few.</p><p><strong>Does age become a barrier for entrepreneurs, given that the willingness to take risks is generally varying?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p><i>Age is just a number!</i></p></blockquote><p>No, it’s not like that. The problem is not age, it’s the liabilities one has to take care of. If you have to take care of education loans or some other liabilities, it will stop you from taking risks. If you have a family to look after, you won’t put everything at stake for a start-up. So, it’s the liabilities that stop you, not the age.</p><p><strong>What final message would you give to the students planning to venture into entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>Yes. Before you start, please use Google first. It’s the simplest and easiest thing that everybody avoids, but it eventually matters. You need to understand your market, you need to do a lot of research, and you need to build things that people need, not what you think people need.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Harsh Sawnani, Talent Acquisition Leader, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020 organised by E-Cell DTU.</i></p><p><strong>What are some characteristics you look for in a job candidate?</strong></p><p>I think&nbsp;<i>passion</i>&nbsp;is the word. For me, passion is paramount, and everything boils down to that. If you come across as passionate, it sets the tone for you to be successful in whichever field you want to pursue. If you’re not good at something, you will get better at it if you keep working on it. Most successful people on this planet are people who have been extremely passionate. If it’s an idea that you want to turn into success, you must be absolutely hawk-eyed with blinkers. The gravitational pull of that passion will make sure that you keep evolving. You gain more knowledge if you’re passionate. If you’re passionate about leaving an impression, then you’ll make sure that you invest in your subject matter expertise as well. If you’re passionate about clearing your interview, then you will do your research on it, you will talk to people who have cleared it in the past. That research, that growth mindset, all of it will follow if you have passion in the first place.</p><p><strong>The topic of failure was often touched upon in the discussion today. You mentioned that you failed in your college exams 10-15 years ago. How have the challenges changed over a span of fifteen years? Do you still feel dejected when you fail, or do you view failure as an opportunity?</strong></p><p>I was talking about the time when I had a Nokia 3315, and today the scenario is completely different. Things have changed dramatically over the last fifteen years, since every five years, there is a generation change. Now, opportunities and options are limitless. Back then, we were stuck with a few options and were not aware of how others were looking at them due to the restricted flow of information, but it isn’t the same anymore. Problem solving has a whole different array of options to choose from. Instead of the emphasis being on success, like it was twenty years ago, today, failure is acceptable. So, that acceptance of failure and the presence of alternate avenues has changed.</p><p>I look at failure the same way as I did fifteen years ago. It’s how you keep evolving your mental setup that counts. One thing is for sure, more opportunities are bound to come. Don’t get me wrong, I fail now as well, but over time I’ve learnt to incorporate my past expertise to overcome the challenges presented to me. I often say ‘this too shall pass', since it has already occurred and I was able to overcome it then; hence, I’ll be able to overcome it now.</p><p><strong>What would you say are a few red flags that students venturing into entrepreneurship should be aware of?</strong></p><p>Don’t just follow the rat race, and don’t do something just because others are doing it. There is a marked difference between an idea and intellectual property. You can have a great idea, but till the time it converts into intellectual property, in terms of becoming a business unit or a revenue generating model, you are still just maybe playing with fire and hoping against hope. It’s important to be wary of the fact that a great idea is great, but if you don’t have a plan to convert it into intellectual property, then you are stepping into uncharted territory where you’re bound to encounter many pitfalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I think that you should always have a Plan B in your mind, because there’ll be obstacles. When I talk about Plan B, I’m not talking about an escape plan, I’m talking about how and what you’ll do if a certain aspect of your plan doesn’t pan out as you wanted it to. Also, know your competition. Nokia failed because it was never able to cope with the evolution happening all around. Hence, it’s important for you to have alternate options available, concrete plans to convert your idea into intellectual property, and awareness about the changing trends.</p><p><strong>You have talked extensively about ‘</strong><i><strong>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</strong></i><strong>’, a very successful book written by Carol Dweck. What would you say are the books which will help budding entrepreneurs develop and eventually achieve success?</strong></p><p>At the moment, I can only think of this book. I think budding entrepreneurs should focus on learning more about people who have succeeded, and more importantly, they should read about people who have succeeded in recent times. What worked earlier may not work today, but the ground rules and the structure remain the same. The way you deal with people in a certain situation does not change. If you read about people who have succeeded now, you’ll realise that there are some absolute mavericks who have changed the world. Conditioning your mind to think 'it has worked for other people and it will work for me too' is essential. To realise your potential, books are great, but practical knowledge is essential and can’t be avoided. You can’t master cricket without playing it on the field. Practical knowledge is something that you must focus more on, rather than the theory. Theory is necessary to have some perspective, but implementing it and practising it with experienced people is imperative for growth.</p><p><strong>You said that there’s a generation change every five years. Do you think it aggrandises the situation concerning the Indian market, which is already a tough nut to crack, for new companies who are trying to thrive in it?</strong></p><p>I would like to look at it more positively. There are more opportunities in a market like India because it is still not highly developed, yet it is not struggling in terms of basic infrastructure. There is a push by the government too, there are NGOs, and there’s an emphasis on crowdfunding as well. I don’t think a changing environment is a challenge, I think it’s an opportunity for you to see your ideas turn into intellectual property. Regarding the frequent changes in the way generations think, again, I would like to look at it as an opportunity for you to keep yourself fresh and new.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Rajesh Das, CEO and Founder, InLog, who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Startups are not very popular amongst students and there is a lot of inertia against the startup culture. How do you think that we can inculcate in the students that the startup risk is worth taking?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, every university should start an incubator. A lot of collaborative work with the huge DTU alumni network needs to be done as well. I am not aware of the current course structure, but for reaching out to students who are more academically inclined, courses related to startups and entrepreneurship should be introduced too.&nbsp;Most of the times lack of knowledge also agitates people; one may have an idea but not the proper skill set to execute it. An incubator centre can definitely help nourishing that skill set.</p><p><strong>Talking about the startup culture in India, how do you think it has evolved over the years?</strong></p><p>People have seen the opportunities in this sector only recently&nbsp;as earlier the availability and access to the resources was also less. Today, there is a realisation that we can explore ourselves more as an individual and can help resolve the issues around us. Earlier, people would depend on an organisation to implement our ideas. But today with that realisation, I as an individual, with the help of my colleagues and friends can innovate things around us ourselves. We have become more open towards starting our own companies and becoming entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>Given the current startup scenario, what do you think is lacking in terms of the ideas or approaches and how can the quality of startups improve?</strong></p><p>Firstly, the number of people with ideas needs to increase. Once we have a sufficient number of ideas, we can always develop a collaborative approach to build around that idea. If there is a dearth of ideas at the university level, the Alumni wouldn't be able to do much either. Once we have newer ideas in our frame, the Alumni can help a select few of them to grow. The quality of ideas is a concern that comes after we resolve this.</p><p>Also, with more Entrepreneurship Summits like this, people see more success stories and students can now seek inspiration from those stories. The hesitation of taking the first step will thus vanish. The incubation centre can also play a huge role in changing mindsets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are some of the challenges one must be prepared for before starting a startup?</strong></p><p>The challenges during the exploration of the idea can be a huge setback. Shortage of money can be one of the problems. While exploring one's ideas, it becomes difficult to look for venture capitalists. Incubation centres play a really important role in this as most often than not, there is a shortage of availability of seed funds as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think people can pursue their calling, if they believe it's too late to start?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The fear of failure or not doing well needs to go away.</p></blockquote><p>It is never too late to start. Finding your purpose is a journey in itself. Once you start that journey, you can redefine your purpose. You can always change your career, all you need to do is explore and find your passion and develop it. This can only happen once you start believing in yourself. The fear of failure or not doing well needs to go away.</p><p><strong>What is your advice for students who would like to venture into the entrepreneurship field?</strong></p><p><i>Search for self.</i> We really need to understand that the world is changing and&nbsp;there is an ecological division, social division, and self-division. People need to connect with each other, understand their purpose and relate with their ideas.</p>",

It is still one of the top choices for engineering aspirants. The campus size has increased after the transition and the facilities have also been upgraded. I have been a recruiter at DTU and realized that the students of this college have recognizable leadership qualities. This makes us want to visit the campus year after year.</p><p><strong>What is that one red flag that you recognize before you decide to hire any failed entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>I think that it's not about failure but the situation that one has been through. This depends upon many factors such as the market not being ready, the target audience not being the exact fit, or the marketing strategies not working out. Although these things might lead to failure, they do not judge a person's capabilities in the long run. Organisations are happy to have workers back if they work diligently.</p><p>Perception is also a major factor. Once upon a time,&nbsp;<i>Bata</i>&nbsp;wanted to launch its brand in Africa. But a lot of critics were against this idea with the argument that the majority don’t wear shoes in Africa. Someone saw this as an opportunity and it eventually became a big hit. It is important to remember that every company starts with just one problem statement. Thus, it is important that a candidate can look through any problem statement and devise their ideas around it.</p><p><strong>How do you think that Entrepreneurship Summits like these can help a student inculcate an entrepreneurship mindset?</strong></p><p>One of the best things about this generation is that you people start thinking from a very early age. Fifteen years back, job was the only opportunity seen by the youth. Businesses were directly inherited by some people from their families, otherwise, everyone was literally pushed into jobs. In this field, a lot of work is being done. Many international companies like&nbsp;<i>AliBaba</i>&nbsp;have started to invest in our country. We have the skills and opportunities. They just need to fund us and we are ready to grow with them.</p><p><strong>It becomes very difficult for startups to thrive in the competitive market of MNCs. Would you have any advice for startup founders or students are potentially seeking to become an entrepreneur to cope with the competition?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One should know three things very well - their target audience, their market and their product. Not every day is rainbows and sunshine. There will always be a boom time and then there would be times when your risk-taking abilities would be challenged. There is no rocket science to it but only sticking true to the belief that one would sail through the tough times!</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Mr. Sandro Stephen, Regional Head, Indian Angel Network, who was a guest at Start-up Conclave 2020, organized by USME.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What factors do you think are instrumental in distinguishing a start-up from its competitors in India? What advice would you give out to young entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas?</strong></p><p>Mostly, everything in today’s day and age can be copied. However, the crucial and differentiating factor is how you execute the idea. The entire value of the product lies in its execution. If you can seamlessly execute the idea, then you will encounter fewer obstacles through your journey.&nbsp;</p><p>A critical piece of advice that I generally give out is that one should find a mentor. A mentor can immensely change the face of the company by thoroughly shaping the idea. Mentors bring the ‘magic-sauce’ with them, and their vast knowledge can help the company in numerous ways.</p><p><strong>In the 90s, almost every venture was somehow trying to incorporate Information Technology. Today, that place has been replaced by Artificial Intelligence. Do you think these trends affect the entrepreneurship sector when it comes to inducting them?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, technological advancements such as Artificial Intelligence are more like enablers. In the long run, these technologies will adapt to the ventures and will be the norm. For example, in the past, having a website was itself rare for a venture. Eventually, it became routine, and mobile apps were the new trend. Similarly, AI too, will become a fundamental part of an enterprise in the future.</p><p><strong>How can university students with hazy start-up ideas and lack of direction make the best use of start-up Incubators?</strong></p><p>Incubators help you to shape your ideas holistically. This is because they provide you mentors, rather than you having to hunt for them. Alternatively, you can also identify the people who you would want as your mentors and request the Incubator Manager to aid you in connecting with them. This will, in turn, help to improve yourself in multiple aspects.</p>",

What were the difficulties you had to face when you were starting out, especially when people weren't open to the startup culture?</strong></p><p>One of the hardest things in the startup culture is convincing your family about pursuing a startup. Even when we were a couple of years down the road, we had already started Binary, there were many people who were questioning my parents as to why they didn’t discourage me from leaving my public sector job. Another challenge was the flow of capital. There was nothing like incubation or seed fund back then. Even the banks wouldn’t give us a loan because we started Binary Semantics as a software company and banks did not understand the word ‘software’.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Even the banks wouldn’t give us a loan because we started Binary Semantics as a software company and banks did not understand the word ‘software’.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Initially, we didn’t have the capacity to employ too many people either. Even in the Software Development field, I was playing the roles of a developer, an analyst, a tester, project manager, and a program manager; and there’s a wide variety in all these fields and it also involves multiple technologies and expertise in multiple domains.</p><p><strong>As you mentioned, as an entrepreneur, one has to play multiple roles. Did this excessive workload ever burn you out?</strong></p><p>We would do a lot of small and simple things ourselves as well, and our roles would range from being a salesperson on the street to roles involving being a finance person. Because initially, we didn’t have the capacity to actually employ a finance person and coordinate each and everything. Those were days we did not even have a fax machine; so to go send a fax, we had to run to the market and use a fax machine.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe I have played numerous such roles and I’m just talking about a few of them here. I think you just have to figure out a way to do them and enjoy what you do; when you enjoy what you do, the goal is clear and then adaptation is the least of problems.&nbsp;</p><p>There were times when I had to work for eighteen hours straight. However, if I had to do just one thing for eighteen hours, I would get a burnout. Doing five different things gave me more energy. After all, variety is the spice of life.</p><p><strong>What was your vision when you started and what’s been motivating you all these years?</strong></p><p>I was passionate about entrepreneurship right from my childhood. Despite not having businessmen in my family, it somehow came into my head. When I was in school, I wanted to be a doctor and set up a chain of hospitals. Back then, my vision was limited to just India. I eventually ended up in engineering and computer sciences, and my vision changed to something global.</p><p><strong>How do you see Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence impacting the Indian Market?</strong></p><p>Several people think that Machine Learning will reduce jobs. I believe that it is going to change the nature of jobs. It will reduce some jobs and it will increase the number of jobs as we need a variety of skills. We see a huge number of opportunities all around but there are still very few takers.</p><p><strong>What role do you think the research environment at a university level can play, to inculcate an entrepreneurial mindset in the youth?</strong></p><p>With the kind of manpower and resources that we have across the country, better research facilities accompanied by better research ecosystem will be helpful, because it's not just the facilities, but also it is the mindset.</p><p>A lot of times people are driven by the glamour of being able to do something very quickly overnight, although any area that you take up, success might be guaranteed, but it doesn’t happen overnight. So, along with the facilities, the ecosystem also plays a significant role. The way the word ‘startup’ has gained respect in the last ten years, ‘research’ also must be respected and glamorised.</p><p><strong>What, according to you, is the key element that most entrepreneurs end up overlooking?</strong></p><p>One of the key things people miss out on is,<i> the vision or purpose</i>. When starting something new, some people consider making more money as their objective. However, money is something we all need - like air - and hence it can’t be a sole vision to build something new.</p>",

I chose to come to Airtel because India is one of the last bastions where there is a very big chance of growth happening in the next ten years. For any product manager, the dream is to be part of such a group. Also, the problems in India are very real, for example, if you look at the number of people with life insurance in this country, it is around 4%, one of the lowest in the world. So the problem is very real and it is a product manager’s dream to go behind such a problem. Airtel is a company where you have 300 million customers and 2000 enterprises, so it already has scale. The opportunity to innovate at airtel and go after these problems is a dream come true.&nbsp;</p><p>That is how I see progression in India and at Airtel. Wynk is one part of the larger problem where we are trying to solve around how entertainment is delivered to the country. Other areas where we are helping are around health, data, learning, education. In summary, the journey at airtel has been nothing short of incredible.</p><p><strong>There are a lot of international competitors in the areas that you have mentioned. What would be the role of Airtel in those sectors?</strong></p><p>We have thought a lot about it. Airtel has got four platforms which are data, network, distribution, and payments. If you talk about data, we have one of the largest repositories of data in India. In distribution, we reach about 300 million people. In payments, 300 million people pay us every month. And we are the network. Any business that sits at the edge of these four pillars, we will build. So we have built IoT which is a combination of network and data pillars. Advertising is another area where we will invest and build because we have distribution and data.&nbsp;</p><p>For other business verticals like agriculture, health, etc., we will support other companies. <i>Vahan</i> is a good example of a company that is trying to provide jobs to migrants to help the economy. Airtel is partnering with Vahan to power their business through the pillars of distribution and data. So through partnerships and our core strengths, I believe we can help India grow.</p><p><strong>How do you plan on solving the problem of trucks in India?</strong></p><p>You are referring to the work I did at <i>Convoy</i> in the US. If you look at <i>Rivigo </i>and <i>BlackBuck</i>, they are Indian companies that are trying to solve the Indian trucking problems. Airtel is not focused on this problem at this time. We believe in supporting the young startups that are solving this problem.&nbsp;</p><p>If we put the systems that we built in the US in India, truck drivers won’t be able to use the app which will be in English. So you have to start looking at the problem from the India perspective. We need to solve for the various languages that drivers in India speak. Maybe we need a voice-first platform. You have to build technology that works for them. The bottom line here is that we should focus on the problem and then find the solution to the problem. One of our values is to “Love the problem, not the solution”, something I learnt at <i>Convoy</i>.</p>",

The role of a teacher has always been the most challenging yet rewarding experience, as your organisation rightly emphasises. How do you think the duties and responsibilities of teachers have changed over the years?</strong></p><p>Essentially, I believe it was a very coveted profession. However, now the status quo has changed and it is not as coveted as before. The best minds of our society are not opting for teaching as a profession. On the other hand, the profession has become more demanding and there are more responsibilities bestowed on teachers. I believe the administrative work is only increasing for them and the environment around education is not very conducive as such. The Right to Education Act and the No-detention policy have also caused a lot of issues in the country. I believe the profession has become very challenging and not as rewarding as it previously was.</p><p><strong>One cannot deny the high degree of inequality that prevails in our society consequent of which, technology-aided educational tools haven’t been introduced in the rural areas. However, the most affluent educational institutions of the country have almost completely been dependent on such tools in carrying out learning activities. How is your organisation addressing this problem of inequality and working to overcome these challenges?</strong></p><p>In our view, inequality will always persist if more focus and emphasis is given to technology led solutions. There is an effect called the ‘Matthews effect’ which basically states that the affluent strata will be able to access more of the benefits from these solutions than the people who are not as affluent. Therefore, in our view, if equitability and inclusiveness has to be ensured in education, it has to be done by ensuring that the teachers are educated to teach and that is our entire approach, we are trying to bring all teachers the learning opportunities so that they can learn better and hence, teach a better class.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to start Million Sparks Foundation and what is your advice to aspiring investors who are just starting out?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The driving force which motivated me was the current deplorable condition of the education system in the country. In my opinion, there is a lot to be done and unless we do something about it, the future of close to 400-500 million children in the next decade or so, is at stake.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The future of industry is very different from what we are experiencing today and the kind of skills which will be required will be quite divergent. Today, the focus is on numeracy and literacy. There is no way through which you can continue to be able to provide jobs to 50 - 100 million children for another 30 years, solely on the basis of numeracy and literacy. They will definitely be required to possess a multitude of skills which are imparted only through teachers. My advice to investors, is that I have no advice!&nbsp;</p>",

He is also an awardee of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology.</i></p><p><strong>One of the fields you specialize in is quantum mechanics. Now that many countries are upping their funding for quantum technology, how do you see it affecting the life of the ordinary citizen in the near future?</strong></p><p>It is very difficult to predict, but you can see how technology has affected our lives. How you use the Internet or YouTube is in your hands. You can either waste your time, or you can actually learn stuff by listening to the lectures of Richard Feynman. However, if you want to harness technology and effectively reduce poverty, you must back it via education. I met a taxi driver, and I asked him why he hadn’t registered himself as an Uber driver. He said he cannot speak English. This man could've earnt 4 times as much with technology, but he is hampered by his education. Education and health must be in the hands of the government and cannot be privatized. Women’s education is also very important. I recently gave an interview at a college of Delhi University and I said the same thing - we require Nobel Laureates and great minds, but we also require industry builders, institution builders, people who lay the foundations for others to succeed on, like Jamshedji Tata, Abdul Kalam, Meghnad Saha, Homi Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai etc. What one man creates leads to more innovators in the future and more development for the country.</p><p><strong>You are one of the leading authors in the field of Optics. How do you feel about your book 'Optics' being the go-to reference for such an important topic, especially in undergraduate courses?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I feel really happy, but everything does require improvement. It’s a good book, but it could be better. I am currently working on the 7th edition; earlier it used to be in black and white, but now the publishers said they will bring out a 4-coloured edition. There is always room for improvement and whatever it is that you do, you should always seek to better it, be it for yourself or for your country.</p><p><strong>We have seen a trend where science and religion often end up in conflict over their separate ideologies. As future researchers, how can we ensure the existence of science and religion in harmony?</strong></p><p>What is religion? Religion is meant to make you a good human being, to make sure you have compassion for others so that you can do good for society. Islam teaches you that if your neighbour does not have food, then your food is of no value. You must share your food and give <i>sevai</i> to the entire community on the occasion of Eid. Religion is a philosophy of life which teaches you to be good to others, but people make it divisive, and that is wrong. Religion is supposed to make you a better person irrespective of the religion you follow. I tell all my younger relatives that the most important thing is compassion towards mankind as a whole. Have compassion towards those 300 million who live below the poverty line and are much less privileged than you. However, India’s strength has and always will be our diversity. Homi Bhabha was a Parsi, Jamshedji Tata was a Parsi, Abdul Kalam was a Muslim, Meghnad Saha a Dalit. When the Constitution doesn’t discriminate, why should we?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any message you would like to give to the students of this University who one day might hope to become as accomplished as you?</strong></p><p>Much better than me, I hope! I have just worked hard. Bhatnagar award is a good thing, and I am very lucky to get it. There are n number of people who are more competent than me and still haven’t secured it. This is true even for the Nobel Prize - Satyendra Bose or KS Krishnan could’ve received the Nobel Prize. I often start my speeches with the statement that on 28th February, 1928, KS Krishnan discovered the Raman Effect, making him the first person to discover the Raman shift of spectral light. Yet most of us do not know about him, as he was a student of Raman. I, therefore, place Meghnad Saha and Homi Bhabha much higher than CV Raman. They built institutes for us, for the future generations to follow in their steps. My message is that your generation has technology in its hand; use it judiciously, use it wisely. You have so much information available to you; learn from it, and whatever you do, give back to the society, use your technology to build institutes, and to uplift the people.&nbsp;</p>",

What do you think deters young girls in middle and high school from entering STEM related fields?</strong></p><p>We need to break this out into two categories: one comprises the privileged class who have access to the best facilities in this country, and the other is the unprivileged class, where young&nbsp; boys and girls are the first generation in their families to get proper education. I focus on the challenges that the latter face. Mostly, it is the financial challenges that come forward; however it is the societal challenges that act as the first barrier. A lot of them still think that a woman needs to get married the moment she turns eighteen and that this is her prime duty. This mentality needs to change, and that is why initiatives like ‘<i>Beti Padhao Beti Bachao</i>’ are of utmost importance. You have to educate a child. The first step in educating a girl child is to start within the family. The first societal change we have to make is to increase awareness among the parents about the importance of education. The societal pressure of getting a girl child married can be destroyed only by making higher education more accessible to them.</p><p><strong>Do you think societal barriers are overpowering the financial barriers in real life?</strong></p><p>Yes, I do think social barriers have become the primary cause of concern now. Even if you look at the well-to-do families, an orthodox mentality still persists. They think that after a certain age a girl becomes too old to get married. That is the primary social barrier of marriage. During my 20s, if a girl turned 25, she was considered past her marriageable age. I got married when I was 28, and that is something society talked about a lot in those days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Numerous studies have found that women in the STEM field publish less, are paid less for their research and do not progress as far in their careers. According to you, what steps should be taken so that women are able to enter this conventionally male-dominant sphere?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think this is a very Western narrative. A lot of western narratives don’t fit into Indian contexts.</p></blockquote><p>I don’t think women are paid less in India. Once they enter science fields and have the same job as a man, no woman is paid less. In fact, I think we have an added advantage of tax rebate. The situation is quite contrary in the West. How can two people; irrespective of their gender, doing the same job, be paid less? This is something I tweet about a lot.&nbsp;<br>I think there exists another social barrier: the belief that women can’t do physics or math; that they are not as good with technology. A fear is birthed in our minds if we are told repeatedly that we can’t handle technology. The developed world is equally regressive, even if you look at the highly developed countries like the USA, women have a hard time breaking into male dominated areas. This is a misconception that prevails in all parts of the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don’t you think the journey of women to the same position as that of a man is tougher?</strong></p><p>I agree, it is tougher. We have to manage our home, kids, parents and even in-laws. I think the current and coming generations will face this problem. Eventually this may become more equal. Apart from that, there also exists a gender bias, especially in my generation. We face it almost every day. A woman is not expected to laugh too loudly or intermingle with men too much. She has to be too straight-jacketed. That limits her on her way up, professionally. She’s not able to network due to her family or societal restrictions. A&nbsp; lot of invisible barriers exist on every step. So, I think she is more careful and works twice as hard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Even though women have made remarkable achievements in STEM fields, there is barely any acknowledgment. Only 3% of Nobel prize awardees are women. Why do you think the world finds it tough to acknowledge their achievements?</strong></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Our culture will have you believing that <i>women cannot be thinkers</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Again, this is due to a very strong mindset among people which has been prevalent for perhaps thousands of years. If I am saying something which makes sense, it is likely to go unacknowledged simply due to my gender. But If the same thing comes from a man, his words will be considered pearls of wisdom. This is a genuine problem in the current scenario. Words coming from a man are given more weightage than those from a woman. We have to constantly fight against this.</p><p><strong>Do you think this effect will wear out with time, and that things will start equalizing?</strong></p><p>It will depend on how much the next generation gives weightage to women’s thoughts and their contribution to the development of society. I think it is possible, for I see the younger generation being more open-minded, empathetic and feminist. So, I am very positive and hopeful. I have seen changes within my life span and I think women are in good position now.</p><p><strong>You joined the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser as a Senior Adviser in 2019. What does the job entail and how has your experience been till now?</strong></p><p>I was with the <strong>Department of Biotechnology</strong> within the <strong>Ministry of Science and Technology</strong>, which is a funding agency. We were funding biological sciences across India. I was responsible for the international collaborations, and was working with the international community across the world. When I came to this office, the canvas grew widely. Now I have to look at Artificial Intelligence, the National Education Policy and the new National Research Foundation which is being setup. Also, I handle science outreach programmes like ‘<i>CodeIndia</i>’, where we put in efforts to teach the school students how to code. We are looking and setting up astronomy labs across schools in India. &nbsp;</p><p>My main role is to take up Waste-to-wealth projects, like finding ways to get rid of dumpsites in <i>Ghazipur </i>or <i>Okhla</i>, cleaning our water bodies, eradicating the waste that surrounds us etc. Through policies, I want to get the government to change the way they perceive the relation between science and economic growth. Why can’t we have Raman spectrophotometer manufacturing units here? I would like to see young students like you make a difference, or at least a contribution. We will be reaching out to all of you to help in these projects, which is welcome to contributions by the whole country.</p><p><strong>You talked about the foreign collaborations wherein you had collaborated with Stanford University to bring in the Foldscope and the Barapullah Drain project. How do these collaborations shape and influence the works that you do?</strong></p><p>We did the Foldscope collaboration with <strong>Stanford University</strong>, developed by <strong>Prof. Manu Prakash</strong>. The <strong>Foldscope</strong> is a foldable microscope and the cheapest in the world, costing less than a dollar. We provided these in some of our government schools. Bringing such affordable and easy-to-use technology to our most resource constraint areas is our motive. If you visit the government schools in Delhi, you won’t find any apparatus or laboratory equipment. The situation of state government schools is worse. So, getting these technologies at cheaper rates and making them accessible to the students, to the extent that they can keep a foldscope like a geometry box in their bags can change the way we think about science. Having a foldable microscope in every child’s bag will bring out the scientists within them.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Barapullah Drain</strong> project was again brought about by working with various other countries. When we collaborate with other countries, we have to make an impact. Doing minor things together is not going to work. The Barapullah Drain is the second largest in the city and cleaning it will be challenging task, that is why we are very excited about the project.</p><p><strong>Do you have any message for the budding female engineers of DTU?</strong></p><p>Don’t let anything deter you. Don’t let people tell you what you can and cannot do. Break the stereotypes. Believe in yourself; you really are the future. With more and more women entering DTU, you will see the difference in how the college performs and how it eventually becomes better.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Commodore (Dr.) RK Rana, Honorary Startup Advisor who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</i></p><p><strong>We will start the discussion with Navy. You have spent a long time serving in the Navy. Can your experiences when you started out and how did it change in all these years in terms of technology and infrastructure?</strong></p><p>Considering the technological development within the Naval Environment, we started with the good old boilers and steam turbine. I am a mechanical engineer. The technology has over a period of time improved considerably, whether you see the main propelling system of our generation or the weapon system, as the computing technology has advanced so has the ability of the weapon systems or the control system. What used to be controlled manually in now being controlled using screens and other technological appliances. The capability of the ships has also increased considerably. We are now getting ships with enhanced stealth because the signaling management onboard the ships have been gaining a lot of importance. We have submarines that can detect ships within a radius of 1 mile. Whether it is onboard ships or self-noise generation, we have improved upon technology considerably.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing of pride is that the Indian Navy has been designing and building ships for last six decades unlike the Army and the Air Forces who have been buying their fighting platforms. I was a part of the design team designing the Air Craft carrier for seven years at the Directorate of Naval Design at Delhi. As a Principal Director, I was looking at mapping and enhancing the self-reliance capability of the Navy. So, I was a part of the designing team of the said air craft carrier which is one of the largest ships designed and being built. It is already in water and will be getting commissioned shortly. Over a period of time, thanks to the technological improvement and the education level of the officers, we have much potent fighting capability within the country.</p><p><strong>You made your career in military , then you shifted to consulting and now you help people in their businesses and startups . What is your take on this transition?</strong></p><p>I initially worked with a global British MNC for four years handling their business and now I am more into social work. In the private environment you have to do everything yourself, in the Fauj, everyone has a big paraphernalia, I had the luxury that when I would get out of the car, someone would open the door, someone would pick up my luggage. I never needed all of that however, I always did all that myself. When I shifted to the private sector the first thing they asked me was whether I'd be needing a large staff or not since they know the lifestyle we are accustomed to. &nbsp;One has to be independent in the private sector. I never really felt the difficulty since I used to work by myself, hence the transition was simple for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mostly after engineering, the obvious choice is to go for further studies or jobs. How did you realize what was your calling and what made you join the military?</strong></p><p>I am from a military background, my father also being in the Army. I grew up in that environment where my father was constantly travelling between postings. It has been a tradition that somebody from a military family would always join the armed forces, and that is what motivated me to join the armed forces.</p><p>I had the mindset to do my best in whatever I will do. Fortunately, I have been lucky enough to gain an experience in all domains while serving in the Navy. When people look at the Navy they see it as only a ship fighting. However, there is a lot which goes on as the support activity for the fighting platform to deliver its best. A ship has a huge amount of other activities going on and I have faced many challenges during operations because of our activities in extraneous circumstances. Many people ask me about these, so I tell them that the moment we join armed forces, we sign our death warrant on day one. That is how our mindsets are.&nbsp;</p><p>When I initially joined, I was on a ship which faced a storm. The ship was operating near Visakhapatnam. I was in a tanker but still the waves could be felt. I find myself lucky that I am alive and speaking today. It was raining heavily, the time of heavy monsoons. We were facing sea state 3 or 4 and there was a defect and some roof was leaking. So I went out and my commanding officer did not know but we took a small turn and we slipped out. I happened to hold the stantion for support and pulled myself in. Otherwise it was pitch black and I wouldn't be here today.&nbsp;</p><p>In south east Asia, all the tycoons are named. In the year 2000, we went to south china sea on a diplomatic mission and we faced almost sea state 8 or 9, the highest, roughest there is. The ship was jumping up and down. Those were difficult environment, even the machinery gets bad, but because of the determination and bravery of the men, they had been repairing and maintaining them to ensure that the propeller keeps moving. Making it out of these situations leaves you with a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie between your brothers in arms. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you feel about the transition of DCE from DTU? Do you think this has impacted the functioning in some way?</strong></p><p>DCE as a part of Delhi University had a lot of limitations. The&nbsp;faculty was highly experienced but there was a deficit of opportunities. I feel that DTU has opened many gates for the students and the situation has definitely improved. It is not a routine environment of lectures and practicals anymore. DTU conducts many startup events to help the students, extra curricular activities, more societies have opened to up to help the students follow their passion. Many people still believe that DCE was better, however I am not of that mindset.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Most of engineering graduates don’t know the opportunities that exist in the military etc. what would you want our readers to know more about these opportunities and jobs?</strong></p><p>The best resource available to you is to make use of the alumni that are involved in these forces and take their assistance in visiting these ships, to see how things are arranged.

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Commodore (Dr.) RK Rana, Honorary Startup Advisor who was a guest at the Entrepreneurship Summit 2020, organised by E-Cell DTU.</i></p><p><strong>How has your experience changed in all these years in terms of technology and infrastructure?</strong></p><p>Considering the technological development within the Naval Environment, we started with the good old boilers and steam turbine. I served as a mechanical engineer and the technology has over a period of time improved considerably, whether it is the main propelling system or the weapons system, as the computing technology has advanced so has the ability of the weapon systems or the control system. What used to be controlled manually is now being controlled using screens and other technological appliances. The capability of the ships has also increased considerably. We are now getting ships with enhanced stealth because the signalling management onboard the ships have been gaining a lot of importance. We have submarines that can detect ships within a radius of 1 mile. Whether it is onboard ships or self-noise generation, we have improved upon technology considerably.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing of pride is that the Indian Navy has been designing and building ships for the last six decades unlike the Army and the Air Forces who have been buying their fighting platforms. I was a part of the design team designing the Air Craft carrier for seven years at the Directorate of Naval Design at Delhi. As a Principal Director, I was looking at mapping and enhancing the self-reliance capability of the Navy. So, I was a part of the designing team of the said aircraft carrier which is one of the largest ships designed and being built. It is already in the water and will be getting commissioned shortly. Over a period of time, thanks to the technological improvement and the education level of the officers, we have much potent fighting capability within the country.</p><p><strong>You made your career in the armed forces, then you shifted to consulting and now you help people in their businesses and startups. How has this transition been?</strong></p><p>I initially worked with a global British MNC for four years handling their business but now I am more into social work. In the Fauj, everyone has big paraphernalia and staff, I had the luxury that when I would get out of the car, someone would open the door, someone would pick up my luggage. I never needed all of that however, I always did all that myself. When I shifted to the private sector the first thing they asked me was whether I'd be needing a large staff or not since they know the lifestyle we are accustomed to. &nbsp;One has to be independent in the private sector, you have to do everything by yourself. I never really felt the difficulty since I used to work by myself, hence the transition was simple for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mostly after engineering, the obvious choice is to go for further studies or jobs. How did you realize what was your calling and what made you join the military?</strong></p><p>I am from a military background, my father also having served in the Army. I grew up in that environment where my father was constantly travelling between postings. It has been a tradition that somebody from a military family would always join the armed forces, and that is what motivated me to join the armed forces.</p><p>I had the mindset to do my best in whatever I will do. Fortunately, I have been lucky enough to gain an experience in all domains while serving in the Navy. When people look at the Navy they see it as only a ship fighting. However, there is a lot which goes on as the support activity for the fighting platform to deliver its best. A ship has a huge amount of other activities going on and I have faced many challenges during operations because of our activities in extraneous circumstances. Many people ask me about these, so I tell them that the moment we join armed forces, we sign our death warrant on day one. That is how our mindsets are.&nbsp;</p><p>When I initially joined, I was on a ship which faced a storm. The ship was operating near Visakhapatnam. I was in a tanker but still the waves could be felt. I find myself lucky that I am alive and speaking today. It was raining heavily, the time of heavy monsoons. We were facing sea state 3 or 4 and there was a defect and some roof was leaking. So I went out and my commanding officer did not know but we took a small turn and we slipped out. I happened to hold the stantion for support and pulled myself in. Otherwise it was pitch black and I wouldn't be here today.&nbsp;</p><p>In South-East Asia, all the tycoons are named. In the year 2000, we went to south china sea on a diplomatic mission and we faced almost sea state 8 or 9, the highest, roughest there is. The ship was jumping up and down. Those were difficult environment, even the machinery gets bad, but because of the determination and bravery of the men, they had been repairing and maintaining them to ensure that the propeller keeps moving. Making it out of these situations leaves you with a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie between your brothers in arms. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you feel about the transition of DCE from DTU? Do you think this has impacted the functioning in some way?</strong></p><p>DCE as a part of Delhi University had a lot of limitations. The&nbsp;faculty was highly experienced but there was a deficit of opportunities. I feel that DTU has opened many gates for the students and the situation has definitely improved. It is not a routine environment of lectures and practicals anymore. DTU conducts many startup events to help the students, extracurricular activities, more societies have opened to up to help the students follow their passion. Many people still believe that DCE was better, however I am not of that mindset.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Most of the engineering graduates don’t know about the opportunities that exist in the military. What would you want our readers to know more about these opportunities and jobs?</strong></p><p>The best resource available to you is to make use of the alumni that are involved in these forces and take their assistance in visiting these ships, to see how things are arranged. We have similar kind of machinery on board as in the industries, but the scales are very different. The density of the equipment is very different. In a factory, space is a luxury, whereas on a ship, everything has to be packed inside a set volume. On a submarine it is even worse, you have to literally crawl around to do maintenance and operation.</p><p>The armed forces do have an outreach program, where they are taking in individuals and innovators in far-flung areas, such as deserts, to have a practical feel of the environment in which they would have to operate. I have always felt that the Indian mind, is a very innovative and fertile mind and which needs to be levelled upon by the country. I used to be very instrumental in putting people across, to facilitate visits to the ships and have taken a lot of initiatives to encourage the young.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you think that we can improve the Research and Development opportunities of DTU?</strong></p><p>Earlier research was considered to be a bad word.

    "body": "<p>Currently, the world feels less like reality and more like an episode of ‘Black Mirror.’ Only a few months ago, it was beyond our wildest imaginations that an epidemiological threat such as the novel coronavirus was in store for us. The virus has disrupted not only our entire way of living but also threatened the global economy at an unprecedented level.</p><p>Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of IMF, called the virus <i>\"</i><a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/02/19/finding-solid-footing-for-the-global-economy/\">the world's most pressing uncertainty</a><i>\"</i>. The prime reason for this is the economic significance of the country wherefrom the virus originated: China. After the virus was discovered in Wuhan, which is one of the commercial capitals of China, the government began assessing the extent of the infection. Upon realizing that the virus was not limited to Wuhan, the Chinese government shut down factories in the affected regions. The major implications of this move were trade-offs in terms of short-term employment prospects for migrant workers and, more significantly, long-term effects on global supply chains.</p><p>In economic terms, a global supply chain is a dynamic worldwide network that arises when a company purchases or uses goods or services from a different overseas company. Disturbing a single link in the chain can cause it to fall apart.&nbsp;</p><p>As manufacturers dependent on Chinese production are forced to decrease their production every day, corporations across the world suffer the consequences. The effects are multiplying with the global movement of the virus. The viral outbreak in Northern Italy, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-lufthansa-imposes-hiring-freeze-as-diageo-profits-suffer-danone\">shut down a firm that supplies electronic parts to automakers across the European Union</a>, meaning auto plants in several countries may need to halt.</p><p>While the markets continue to suffer, cash flow is needed within the system to improve the chances of recovery. This move is exceedingly difficult in the current paradigm due to rampant hoarding by consumers. There are a few effects that need to be considered here. With social distancing and self-isolation quickly becoming the need of the hour, people are less likely to buy certain goods such as food and beverages prepared outside and avail services such as air travel and hotel accommodation. People are more likely to cut back on non-essential spending in order to save for emergency spending in the future. If we add this to the growing problems posed by lack of paid leave and companies laying workers off due to the slowdown, it ultimately results in people having a lot less disposable income to spend on certain sectors, reducing overall demand. However, the current magnitude of these effects is unknown. With more countries joining the list, it may eventually lead to a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/why-do-supply-shocks-occur-and-who-do-they-negatively-affect-most.asp\">supply-shock</a>.</p><p>A question that usually pops up at this point is, <i>\"How is any of this new?\"</i>. We have had bad economic crises in the past; we survived. However, the reason the current scenario presents a unique challenge is because of the uncertainty involved. A basic economic rule: <i>markets run on speculation</i>. Their functioning, the rise and fall of stocks, economic decisions made by corporations, etc. are all based on calculations: determining the best possible outcome based on statistics, experience, and market information. The volatility of the coronavirus situation makes any sort of calculated action an impossibility.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, investors cease to invest and this decelerates cash flow.&nbsp;Businesses may hold off on investments because they are unsure of the extent to which supply chains and international customers are impacted. Internationally, it is not known where and how far the virus will spread. This makes it hard or even impossible to assess the outcome. As these effects are difficult to evaluate, businesses will be unable to determine whether they should continue with various investments. Households, with no idea of how things might pan out, will prefer to save instead of continuing with their regular spending habits. Financial institutions such as banks may reprice credits as they can’t assess the risk of lending to individuals, corporations, or countries.</p><p>With supply chain disruption, reduction in demand, and economic uncertainty, the global economic structure appears to be in crisis. While the virus may not affect a lot of people directly, its ripple effects on society may require a longer period of recovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>Is being quarantined boring you out of your mind? Anoushka Raj, 2nd Year, ENE, Pratiksha Pradhan, 2nd Year, ECE, and Srishti Mittal, 3rd Year, PSCT, bring to you a list of activities to help keep you busy at home.</i></p><p>Exhausting midsems often leave you craving an extended break, but what if that comes at the heavy price of a pandemic? With COVID-19 slowly extending its reach to Delhi, it is essential to stay home and practice social distancing to slow its spread, even if you haven’t been in contact with anyone infected. However, shutting yourself up inside your house without the option of stepping out can quickly get boring. After all, there is a limit to how much you can binge-watch. To help alleviate some of this boredom (and for the times when your parents say ‘<i>sirf sote aur khaate ho, kuch toh corona</i>’), we bring to you a list of things to do while in self-quarantine.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Catch up on your <strong>sleep</strong>. With the hassle of trying (and failing) to maintain the unachievable trinity of classes, extracurriculars, and a social life, college makes you believe that sleep is for the weak. Now that you don’t have assignments and files to tearfully keep you up all night, take this time to get your sleep cycle in order.</li><li>Social distancing does not mean not <strong>communicating</strong> with loved ones. Been intending to have a lengthy conversation with a friend about something that troubles you? Honestly, there’s never been more time, and they’ll have no valid excuse to get them out of this, so get real with your feelings. Text that old friend from school that you haven’t met in a while, reply to the unread texts from your hostel friends, and talk to your family.</li><li>Just because you can’t physically meet doesn’t mean you and your gang can’t do anything together. You can have a <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">Netflix Party</a> with your friends. Finally plan that trip to Goa and cover all the loopholes so that when it’s time to go, no one can back out.</li><li>Write. Paint. Master the guitar that you haven’t picked up in years. With solitude at your fingertips, it is easy to pick up a <strong>hobby</strong> from where you left off. There are some great resources available online for learning various instruments, such as <a href=\"https://www.onlinepianist.com/\">OnlinePianist</a>, which offers piano tutorials for popular songs.</li><li><strong>Clean</strong> out your virtual space by sorting through your hard disk, your phone’s camera roll, your Google Drive files, and the old pen drives gathering dust on your desk.</li><li>Work on your <strong>vocabulary</strong>. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Word-Power-Made-Norman-Lewis/dp/8183071007\">Word Power Made Easy</a>; it improves your grammar and vocabulary in short 30-minute sessions per day.</li><li>Keep that mind going - an idle mind is the devil’s workshop, so don’t loaf around! With no proper schedules telling you what to do, it is easy to fall out of the habit of <strong>studying</strong>. You can do online courses on <a href=\"http://coursera.org\">Coursera</a> or <a href=\"http://www.datacamp.com\">DataCamp</a>, learn a new language, or even study that subject whose mid-semester exam made you collapse into a nervous wreck.</li><li><strong>Exercise</strong>. It’s important to keep your body active. Don’t sweat it out at the gym, since it’s one of the places where the virus spreads most rapidly due to excessive contact and sharing of equipment. Instead, clear out space in your house and work out with the help of <a href=\"https://www.shape.com/fitness/trends/free-online-workouts-coronavirus\">fitness and yoga videos</a> which are readily available on YouTube.</li><li>Spend some quality time with your <strong>family</strong>. You might not get this luxury again for a while once we return to our fast-paced lives. Help them with chores, watch some movies together, or discuss politics. Take out the rusty board games gathering dust in your cupboards and relive a page of your childhood. It’s a great way to bond with your family, and flipping the board over when you lose will let out some frustration. You’re broke in real life too, Monopoly can’t really hurt you any further.</li><li>Remember that working from home and staying in is a privilege, not an inconvenience. In a developing country like ours, scores of people have to be on the streets to earn their daily wage. If you have the advantage of staying home, <strong>be mindful </strong>of and courteous to those who don’t. Tip generously, and be sure to spread the right information to people who might not have access to it.</li><li>Try to spend some time taking care of something that probably won’t give you the virus - we mean <strong>pets</strong> or potted <strong>plants</strong>. Now that you’re quarantined to your house the entire time, there’s no excuse for why the plant wilted away and died.</li><li>For those of you who have no opportunity to learn <strong>cooking</strong> either because you’re confined to your hostels or your academics don’t leave you with much time to get innovative in the kitchen, now’s a perfect time to learn. It’s a vital life skill - don’t run away from it! Plus, it’ll give you something to rub in the faces of all those aunties and uncles who keep asking about your progress in the kitchen rather than in life.</li><li>Coronavirus is a massive threat to everyone and has certainly taken the limelight, but that doesn’t diminish any of the other threats that we and our planet face. Just because you have to wash your hands regularly does not mean that you have to leave the tap running and waste water. Be mindful of your energy and water consumption. <strong>Climate change</strong> and global warming are still very much real, please! We don’t require another crisis once this one quietens down.</li><li>This cannot be stressed enough - prioritize not only your physical but also your mental health. When you’re constantly being bombarded with Coronavirus notifications, it’s easy to get worked up and anxious about the pandemic. Take some time to <strong>detox</strong> from anything Corona related. Flip through some happy and uplifting news to keep your mind from collapsing. Curate the content you consume through social media to keep you at peace. Be it pupper videos or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thegoodadvicecupcake/?hl=en\">Good-Advice Cupcake</a>, find something that will remind you of hope and goodwill.</li></ol>",

How would you advise anybody going through a similar phase during her/his start-up to overcome those challenges which one encounters initially?</strong></p><p>The most important thing is the evaluation of what you want to do and not to be afraid of following your passion because if you’re happy doing something, you are bound to be successful. If doing business was so easy, then everybody would become an entrepreneur but don’t be scared of doing something which you think is not easy. You have to fight the situations and fighting the situations will help you learn a lot which in turn will not only help you in your profession but also in your personal life. The key mantra is ‘<strong>Don’t stop working hard</strong>’ and to be very persistent about what you’re doing and be disciplined.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes when we’re studying, we don’t realise what the educational institution is giving us with its morning prayers and morning classes which may seem very monotonous but help inculcate discipline and work harder.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the day, the only café was <i>Nirula’s</i> (which was technically a family restaurant), and <i>Barista</i> and <i>Café Coffee Day </i>were only selling coffee. There was no proper café serving a multi-cuisine menu which we did. I broke the rules of the industry and gave a new concept to the city.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You believe that the industry can do much better and become a more substantial economic driver if it gets proper government support. You mentioned there are a lot of unnecessary licenses. What else do you think comes under a lot of government scrutiny and needs more liberalisation?&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Can’t you see that the only sport in this country is cricket because the government supports it?</p></blockquote><p>Absolutely! Today the kind of time we devote towards unnecessary government compliances takes away a lot. I would have opened 250 restaurants rather than 25 restaurants so you can imagine the intensity of pain which the government gives us. They don’t have a single-window system as most of their laws are impractical; they plainly don’t know the ground reality. The support of the government is the most significant factor which makes any industry prosper. The support given to us is very minimal, and we keep on fighting for our cause.</p><p><strong>Do you have any parting message for the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>Enjoy what you do! Keep working hard but enjoy what you do. Make your own rules and don’t think somebody has imposed work on you. Always enjoy your work, and you will be successful!&nbsp;</p>",

How can environmental fields of study be transformed so that more students opt for it as a career choice?</strong></p><p>Nowadays, the learning process has become straightforward. Earlier, it used to have a lot more depth. In our times, there was no computer. Data collection, laboratory analysis and interpretation were very time-consuming and done manually. This trend has changed with time. There are many factors which must be considered now in order to build a career.</p><p>Study of the environment is not only science and technology, but it is also about human beings and values. One of the essential elements which is missing in the curriculum is the set of social issues. For example, the problem of water crisis is being taught to the students, but the skill set on how to deal with it practically is something which needs to be inculcated. Economic, social and environmental factors must be included in the curriculum of environmental engineering. The practical application of the solution needs to be stressed upon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>People are very ignorant about the issue of climate change. They assume that nature will \"resuscitate\" and revive itself. What is your take on that?</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Change is inevitable, but the rate of change taking place today is unprecedented.</p></blockquote><p>The concept which needs to be considered is not the change, but the rate of change. Earlier, there wasn't any human impact, so the change was gradual, but now the system cannot adjust to this rapid change. So, awareness must be spread about that. Water crisis has been a significant problem for a very long time. I always wanted to work on water-related issues much before people thought of it as a major concern.</p><p><strong>What has been the biggest challenge in your teaching career so far? What should be the approach of dealing with the problems?</strong></p><p>I enjoy teaching a lot. I always wanted to be a teacher and have been doing it for the past forty years. After completing my studies when I returned to India, it was tough to implement projects here. The rooms were not very well equipped with gadgets and machines, so I had to raise money for the fieldwork and the sources. Finally, I built the ecosystem which I had always desired.</p><p>The students should take an interest in the areas which challenge them. Facing the challenges and overcoming them is something which needs to be done. Dedication, sincerity and an innovative approach are required to excel in the field.</p>",

    "slug": "going-against-instinct-578",
    "body": "<p>A few months ago, I was talking to a friend of mine about monogamy. He talked about how the practice of monogamy among human beings was all but a religious facade. To strengthen his standpoint, he started talking about the evolutionary standpoint of polygamy: that men are wired to seek as many suitable partners as possible.</p><p>40% of unmarried relationships and 25% of married relationships go through at least one incident of infidelity. It is, indeed, a strong argument to support polygamy by labelling it as an instinct in a world where infidelity is universal. I felt that it was important to entertain this thought, because he wasn’t wrong. After all, there’s no justifiable way to condemn a universal instinct. On the other hand, monogamy is a product of civilisation. If we extend this debate above this topic, we get a deeply intriguing question on our hands.</p><p>How often do civilisation’s norms go against human instincts?</p><p>The answer, albeit counterintuitive, is a relatively sensible one. They mostly don’t. If you were to talk about an age of non-commital freedom in companionship, most men would fantasise about it. Some would even express contempt over what it would be like to live in a society that didn’t scorn on polygamy. However, they don’t think about the consequences of companionship becoming a free market. Most men, in the absence of monogamy, would be sexually excluded. There would be a huge disparity between the number of partners associated with a desirable male and a relatively less desirable male. Moreover, a bi-parent system is scientifically more effective in raising a child than a single parent. Thus, the values of long-term companionship, security, and fostering a family come into the picture. It would be logically sound to say that civilisation alters the human experience and talks about overcoming animalistic instincts that were once important. The entire process depends upon realising that those instincts wouldn’t be the most valuable to a modern-day human in the long run.</p><p>In order to further study the contradiction between instinct and civilisation, we can entertain another example. The cultural norm of abstinence is a topic over which there’s been vigorous back-and-forth argument ever since its inception. The desire to procreate is an instinct through which animals keep themselves from going extinct by ensuring the reproduction of future generations. However, in a world that suffers from overpopulation, this instinct loses its significance and the habit of acting on sexual desires becomes voluntary. Cultural norms suggest that you control your libido so that you don’t get addicted to the chemicals released in your brain during acts of procreation. It is so because addiction to these chemicals has detrimental effects on your mental faculties and subsequently, your life.</p><p>One last case to consider is obesity. Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror and cursed God for making high-calorie foods so deliciously tempting? We’re instinctively drawn towards high-calorie foods because there was a time when food wasn’t delivered to our doorsteps. There was a time when human beings had to hunt or search for their meals. Since the status of the next meal was always uncertain, it was grossly favourable that the hunter-gatherer eat high-calorie foods at every chance he got. It was the only way that helped him store extra energy, keeping him energetic for extended periods. But now, in the time of food security, it is culturally mandated that you try to follow a balanced diet and ditch high-calorie foods.</p><p>As time goes by, our survival patterns change along with our surroundings. All of these instincts were created because of patterns drastically different from the current ones. It is only logical that we try to tame them and create our own system of rules which better fits our present lives. This doesn’t mean that having urges towards polygamy makes you a sinner or a terrible human being. It makes you human. No one is instinctively wired towards monogamy, but that doesn’t mean one cannot strive for it.</p><p>Civilisation is a by-product of the one quality that only human beings possess — self-awareness. What distinguishes us is our capability of observing, assessing our own experiences, and comparing them with the experiences of other people to derive some form of meaning from them. It encourages us to create beliefs and pass down valuable insights for our progeny. This never-ending cycle of tweaking our behaviour in accordance with experience is what makes a civilisation truly worthy of its name.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Since, you have been working in the field of education, public service and entrepreneurship. Which two areas significantly come under the government’s control and how do you think private-public partnerships through entrepreneurs can be helpful to India?</strong></p><p>The parts that are significantly under the government’s control have a great impact on education and the people of the country. Millions of people go to government schools, as that may be their only option. The education delivered within government schools, that caters to a significant population, is heavily under government’s control. There are a lot of non- and for-profit organizations that have built new technologies and came up with new methods to reform education. It is interesting that a lot of research and experience is equipped by a large number of upcoming organizations. The government should be open and willing to listen to these organizations because many of them have first-hand grassroot knowledge that other institutions may not have. This can be in terms of knowledge sharing, research or in terms of capacity building. This public-private partnership is possible. Of course, we can see and make sure of its ethics, the transparency, and how the contextualization of it is always kept alive and merited.</p><p><strong>You are also known as the Vivekananda of the 21st century. How do you think the principles of Vivekananda can be adopted in the 21st century by the University students? How can they help the students become disciplined and focused individuals, who can also help building a sustainable community?</strong></p><p>I delivered a speech at Vivekanand hall in Baroda, where Swami Vivekanand had stayed. I got a chance to stay there and to deliver a lecture that crossed over a million views on social media. It was then when the media house declared me as the Vivekanand of the 21st century. I see myself as Swamiji’s worker. Swami Vivekanand once said, “India’s coming glory shall be so great that it’s ancient glory may feed in front of it.” Some people say his thinking was more whimsical or too optimistic. He also said, “My faith lies in the younger generation, out of them will come my workers who will work out the whole problem like lions.” So, instead of being seen as the Vivekanand of the 21st century, I would like to be seen as one of Swami’s workers which he used to talk about. Swamiji frequently talked about education being the manifestation of perfection that is already within. He talked about each soul being potentially divine. He said, ”All the power in the world is within you and it is us who have kept our hands over our eyes and cried about darkness”. He asked the young people to not to go outside and look for consolation or solace. You are divine. You are powerful. You can manifest the education and power from within. That is something that more and more young people should remember. I would like to add something here, this was when somebody from the West asked Swamiji, “What should I do?”, and Swamiji said, “Love India.” That’s the kind of love Swamiji had for India. Swamiji once went to Kanyakumari, to meditate. The place he went to, is now famous by the name <i>Vivekanand Rock Memorial</i>. He meditated there for three days straight and only focused on the past, present and future of India. A patriotic monk, who felt deeply for India, said, ”India being lifted up, can help lift humanity up.” This is the sum and substance of a lot of things that Swamiji used to say. One must become such, who can help others, too, to be the best version of themselves. These are the things that young people should definitely incorporate in themselves.</p><p><strong>What was your journey like, from being home-schooled in Bihar to studying abroad? What inspired you to start Dexterity Global?</strong></p><p>I studied at Tufts University on a full scholarship. But I turned down an offer from Harvard. That was what truly happened. My own lived experiences, being home-schooled for the first twelve years of my life. Reading the newspaper was compulsory as my parents had mandated it. I used to read about other kids winning competitions, securing scholarships that made me wonder if I could do the same. So, I started writing down these opportunities and at the age of twelve I attended school for the first time and started participating in these opportunities. Represented India in over 6 different countries, won over 200 competitions by the time I was in 12th standard. Our education must build leaders for India. We’re teaching them technology to limit themselves. The technology should uplift the people. They teach journalism, then journalism should be lifting them up. If they’re being taught medical science, then that must lift them up. That is the larger idea behind Dexterity. First trying to work hard and strive on my own, and now enabling the youth to do so.</p><p><strong>How do you think Corporate India could be encouraged to take up bigger roles and execute their job and duties in adherence with the model responsibilities that often underlie when working for profitable ventures in other big firms?</strong></p><p>The responsibilities lie with everyone. Corporate India should not see its work limited to corporate social responsibility and that CSR should not just be seen as a formality. We need corporations that set up in the first place to solve challenging problems. Henry Ford did not just set out to make money. He faced the problem and thought there must be a better way for people to go from one place to another. Mark Zuckerberg thought there must be a better way for people to connect with each other. Bill Gates thought about computers running the world and increasing human productivity. So, we don’t just need corporations writing a cheque to a non-profit. We need corporations that set out on a mission to make things that are less carcinogenic, more organic, and can try to lower the price point in a part of industry. So, the role of corporations is also to see that with talent and workforce, to solve a challenging problem.</p><p><strong>How do you think leadership roles have changed in the 21st century in the view of one of your seven visions for repairing the 21st century leadership? What qualities one must expect the leader of the 21st century to imbibe according to you?</strong></p><p>Leadership has not changed in any century. It is the challenges that we must be prepared for, which continue to change and in the 21st century as we continue to advance. I delivered a TED talk once where I talked about how on one end, we need nuclear energy and on the other end, we need nuclear disarmament. On one end, we need more machines and robots and on the other end we need to make sure that we still have that human touch in the products we build. At the pace we’re moving, many challenges have not yet been introduced. So, one needs to build a new company that can grow fast, serve a lot of people and yet not pollute the climate. We need travel companies that connect a grandmother with her grandchild. But, in the process, they should also plan about cutting down on the carbon footprint of the entire journey, that is as beautiful. Air planes have contributed greatly for the Grandmother but must also make sure that her grandson has a better planet to breathe in. These are the challenges. The quality is what we need. Present day leaders need four skills; critical thinking, research, communication and leadership. Two core values; empathy and fearlessness. Two core commitments; public service and nation building and finally they must be driven by a scientific temperament. They must be grounded in spiritual values and those spiritual values shall be focusing on the inner journey as well as being integrated with self and society, and not getting detached.</p><p><strong>What important message would you like to give us and to our leaders?</strong><br><br>Smart people should take action, they should build things, and in a different space. A better space that every young Indian should aspire to contribute towards. Wherever I am, I will build new things. I’ll fix a few old things, I’ll make sure that my presence makes the surroundings better, be it my office or my dinner table discussion. That is something that every young person in the country should strive for, we can truly lead the world if we do this.</p>",

    "slug": "flying-high-falling-hard-572",
    "body": "<p>Quotes and speeches that motivate us to dream big and be ambitious should perhaps come with a precautionary note – ‘Be aware of your current position while doing so’.</p><p>This will significantly improve our financial system, because adding its name to the list of reckless dreamers is the Yes Bank. This private lender, by all accounts, was an ambitious entity which believed in speed. Going against the general flow of the Indian economy, the growth curve of Yes Bank saw an unprecedented rise. When giant Non-Banking Financial Corporations like IL&amp;FS and DHFL, various industries like automobile, fertilizers and the agriculture sector were reverberating with echoes of the economic slowdown, Yes Bank-in a time span of 15 years became the fourth largest private lender of India with total assets of ₹4 lakh crores. This flight unfortunately had a crash landing, which became the epicenter of tremors that could be felt all across the Indian economy.</p><p><strong>What led to this crash?</strong></p><p>According to reports, more than 25% of Yes Bank’s loans were extended to Non-Banking Financial Corporations, real estate firms and the construction sector- three sectors that have been struggling for quite some time. Over exposed to toxic assets and still continuing with their lending spree which led to their advances rising by 334% between financial year 2014 and 2019, Yes Bank collapsed under the weight of its Non-Performing Assets (NPA). As the bank faltered on NPAs, its share prices fell. With a decrease in the public confidence, the number of fresh accounts became meager and the public made huge withdrawals. Yes Bank, thus, lost out on capital from both depositors and debtors.</p><p><strong>State Bank of India to the rescue?</strong></p><p>Reserve Bank of India announced a reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank under which State Bank of India will be spearheading this mission by taking over 49% of the shares at a minimum price of ₹10 per share and not reducing its holding below 26% for 3 years. A host of other changes like placing the bank under a moratorium, forming a new board, writing off all tier-1 capital etc. was announced. But the question here is whether the proposed bailout warranted and what lies ahead for the wider financial sector.</p><p><strong>Why SBI?</strong></p><p>Whenever a non-governmental financial organisation faces fund shortages, the first option is to have private investors come in and infuse their money into the ailing organisation. Yes Bank was given time to work out this way, but due to its NPAs it could not get any investors. The next option is that the government nationalises the private bank i.e. transfers the control and ownership of the bank from private bodies to the state. The government, already struggling with severe fiscal deficits could not afford to do this and hence was reluctant to nationalise Yes Bank. As the last resort, the government got a public sector bank, SBI, to lead this rescue.</p><p><strong>Should Public Sector Banks save distressed Private Banks?</strong></p><p>According to various economists, having a public sector institution to go out of its way for helping another ailing organisation should always be the last resort. As per the latest Financial Stability Report, public sector banks have 12.5% of gross NPAs. The government, over the past few years, has had to infuse ₹3.5 lakh crore of equity into the public sector banks. This clearly shows that the overall banking system is not very healthy and is overburdened with NPAs. In such a scenario, it is never good for a public sector bank to step into the chaos and attempt to facilitate rescue plans. This severely hampers their future growth prospects and scale of functioning, making the financial ecosystem even more fragile. But when we have financial intermediaries like the Yes Bank, which are so interconnected with other banks, mutual funds, NBFCs, real estate firms etc. at the verge of failing, the financial stability of the entire country is at stake and some kind of intervention is required. In this case, with this crisis emerging at the heel of the IL&amp;FS, DHFL fallout and the economic slowdown leaving the government incapable of rescuing Yes Bank themselves, there was no other option left.</p><p><strong>What will be the long-term consequences of such events on the Economy?</strong></p><p>While steps are being taken by RBI and the government to solve the Yes Bank issue which is an immediate problem, a series of continuous fall outs of various important financial organisations has led to a very large trust deficit in the financial ecosystem. The damage to public confidence caused by placing Yes Bank under moratorium and putting a cap on withdrawal of deposits of ₹50,000 is very evident by the fall that several private bank stocks have seen in the past few days. Looking at the larger picture, the very basic foundation of a sound financial ecosystem is trust. If the investing public does not trust the reports on asset quality, direct implications can be seen on funds and financing of the firm. While we have the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the National Company Law Tribunal, they are not sufficient to handle the burden of NPAs that our market is engulfed under. There are more than 2,000 cases pending at the NCLT courts. All this indicates the need of having a one-time solution and a process that facilitates the full and actual disclosure of the state of affairs of a firm. This can significantly reduce the problems of information asymmetry in the market and enhance trust. A sound foundation of trust will create a financial system that will be able to fund the growth trajectory that we aspire for. Otherwise, it will all end where it started – in an ambitious dream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Illustration By Akshansh Aggarwal</p>",

    "biliner": "Amid Corona and Otherwise...",
    "slug": "how-to-avoid-shaking-hands-231",
    "body": "<p>Humorous? Not anymore. The storm clouds, by the name COVID-19, are here bringing upon trouble among the Homo sapiens. The friendliest ones have started keeping it to themselves. Well, it’s important so, why not? The situation calls for it.</p><p>I recently traveled to a workshop in another city. Keeping in mind all precautions and prevention I read about travelling amid the pandemic; washing hands often, maintaining distance from potentially infected ones, keeping a pocket sanitizer ready but when it came to avoiding close contact from people it felt awkward. Upon reaching the workshop, I realized I was bound to greet new people with a handshake with the continuous feeling of not offending anybody by refusing to do so. Although, I was able to dodge some of those coming at my side.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few weeks or months, while greeting new people these might help you navigate this potentially awkward situation:</p><p><strong>Accept that it’s going to feel awkward</strong></p><p>These feel like some small unnoticeable gestures; however, they carry great importance in defining one’s impression. You can never know how the other person perceives your ‘rejection’ to a small gesture such as a handshake. He may take it lightly or seriously depending upon the nature of the person or the bond you two share. According to Andy Molinsky, a professor at Brandeis, “transgressions of professional norms like these can feel awkward because your actions break the routine and script of how you tend to express warm greeting”. This worrying that you feel that you may make a bad impression or send an unfriendly message is normal to exist. The situation can become even more challenging when a superior entity shall be present in front. The reason this situation might be risky is misinterpretation of each other’s gestures or misunderstanding, constantly trying to figure out what you both feel comfortable with – touching elbows? Feet? Fist bumping? Just a wave and who takes the lead.</p><p><strong>Decide ahead of time what you feel comfortable with</strong></p><p>Just before you have to greet a person, make sure of what gesture you want to use so that you feel confident. This will stimulate confidence in the next person as well because the situation becomes clearer. At the workshop, I decided to keep my hands in my pockets to avoid touching, and with a smile on my face I met new people by saying “Since, we’re not allowed to shake hands now…” followed by an elbow bump.</p><p>Maggie Stieg, a senior facilitator with The Ariel Group, explains, “We explored the ways Emirati women let others know they did not shake hands. One of the methods that worked best was simply to place the right hand on the chest (as in the posture of pledging allegiance to the flag). No words seemed necessary with that posture,” during her research program in UAE.</p><p>“A quick wave from a farther distance, before returning your hand back to your pocket, is useful to non-verbally signal that we’re going to forego the normal ritual.” Says Molinsky, after his keen observations on the social life of normal people.</p><p><strong>Use humor to mitigate the awkwardness</strong></p><p>Humor is a great ‘socializer’, as long as it’s light-hearted and intended to connect. People connect better when humor is involved, especially for the fresh meets. It is so powerful that even while breaking a social norm such as a handshake in this case, it can be used as a tool to defuse the discomfort. However, humor should be used wisely and strictly situations specifically and should never come at the expense of somebody’s respect.</p><p><strong>Avoid Judgement</strong></p><p>Under the current circumstances, showing rejection towards physical contacts is legit and you’re not guilty of not expressing your regrets or apologies to anybody. Both of you probably have the same thoughts/judgments about yourselves at the moment; “I’m doing this for the good”, “Am I really scared of this virus?” or “is it such a big deal?”. Now, instead of worrying how your behavior is perceived from the next person, you should realize that we are all under a constant risk, so taking preventive measures is a necessity after all. In India we can use our beloved ‘Namaste’ as a means to greet, this comes with a whole package such as, most importantly, no touching involved, expresses a respectful gesture and No Judgments. Even if you’re not a ‘namaste’ person, reserving judgment and not worrying what others think of you is good advice at all times. Do what you feel like doing, and assume others will understand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Prof. Peer M. Sathikh, Associate Chair (Academic), School of Art, Design and Media, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, who was a guest speaker at the Form Exploration Workshop, organised by the Department of Design.</strong></i></p><p><strong>You are a visiting professor at IIT Bombay, an adjunct professor at VIT and an associate professor at ADM. What differences or striking qualities have you observed over the map of India?</strong></p><p>Over the map of India, in the last ten years, there has been an increase in awareness regarding design and design education. Not just design and design education, but more and more engineering programmes are also understanding that design is not just designing components; it must be all-encompassing and holistic, involving human beings in the process too. For example, take IIT Bombay and VIT. They have different accents. IIT’s have been traditionally experimentalists. They still try to inculcate experimentation and maybe failure is not tolerated, but deviations from the mainstream are. VIT, on the other hand, wants to have a structured education program and it may not look like it, but their end goal is to get their students jobs whereas IIT Bombay is sure that its students will find jobs, so they’re pushing for innovation and creativity. The ideology of IIT Bombay doesn’t centre around finding jobs for its students. They allow their students to prepare their folio, and then the student must stand for himself and seek a job.</p><p><i>So, it’s assumed that ultimately, all students will manage to bag a job, so they urge the students to be fresh and creative.</i></p><p>Exactly. VIT is worried about where its students will end up after four years, so even though their teaching pedagogy is like that of IIT, the students’ expectations are different. The students at IIT want to pick my brain, with good reason, because they want to achieve what I have achieved in certain spheres. At VIT, they want to know how I got my job and how I progressed in my career. What was built in me through IIT was so natural, that once you’re prepared, you can attend the job interview and I’m sure you’ll do well. It’s not arrogance but its confidence. That’s the difference. Overall in India, the design industry and education are at their best right now.</p><p><strong>Do you think there will be an increase in awareness about design education in the future?</strong></p><p>There will be a plateau. Everybody wants to know where their model of design education stands, but in my opinion, each area has its own set of ideologies and philosophy. If you’re able to understand the underlying set of ideologies, it will work all over.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>You must know what has to be embedded and what has to be portrayed.</p></blockquote><p>So, this is my experience of the last ten years of teaching.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are the Associate Chair at the Nanyang Technological University. What differences do you see in design education in India and Singapore?</strong></p><p>In both countries, the students are interested in sustainability. They are a little concerned that their children may not be able to enjoy the world as it is today. The main difference is that you are looking at Singapore, an island city, and only so many designers and media artists can find jobs within, so we are preparing our students for a global experience. You could be in Singapore, but you may be designing for India or China.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas if you look at India, the population is enormous, and there seems to be an internal environment and demand for designers and media artists. So, it brings me to my point. Our way of looking at students is different, and we decided that we can’t be a master of a single element of design and media. At the same time, we cannot water down our efforts so we give a chance to our students to build an interdisciplinary design education curriculum which they would like to pursue. We show them the different courses that are available and what pathways those courses will take you along and depending on what frame of mind you are in at that point of time, we can predict where you will be in five years. The students get to choose. Some of them would say “I want to do product design only” and some of them would graduate as a general designer. So, they can fit into the industry where they are looking for generals.</p><p>We must remember that the mindset of the student and their job functions are different in Singapore. More often than not, most of the students don’t want to join a big company, for the reason that such companies don’t exist. They exist as a headquarters but never as manufacturers. So, they see themselves trying to club together to form short-term companies like joint ventures, or they would like to have shared offices. They try to find jobs which they can do together and make money. But if they get a product-based design job, that’s fine too. “We are a team”, is a trend which is catching on in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think it will catch on in India too?</strong></p><p>The urban society? Yes. But where it is needed is in the suburbs and rural community where our education as designers gives us certain skills, which may be useful to help solve some of the problems of rural India. For example, sanitation has been the biggest issue, but the PwD can’t solve it. We must come up with a more creative way of dealing with it.</p><p>And if this is going to happen, you will see an increase in the numbers of design entrepreneurs who are committed to a social cause. My concern is, where is the business model. At the end of the day, when you settle down, or you are with your mom and dad, they will ask you where the bread and the butter is coming from.</p><blockquote><p>Altruism is not going to give you a business model.</p></blockquote><p>You can have a Gandhian perspective, but it’s not right if you say everything is for free. Because you have a wife and a child to look after and a society to look after. So, what kind of design entrepreneurs will come and how would they portray their business, so people won’t perceive them as taking advantage.</p><p>This is a dichotomy which we all face. We want to make social progress, but we cannot do it if we cannot have our bread and butter. The equation changes when I want to have bread on the table and my son wants to have a cake. So, with that in mind, if I have a business model, and I apply it to a social cause, the powers that be might think I am trying to exploit them. So, this is going to be a challenge for Indian design entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>You are a REP fellow at Nanyang Technological University. Can you tell us about the Renaissance engineering program?</strong></p><p>Renaissance engineering program is a high-level engineering program in Singapore. It is based on the Renaissance movement that happened long ago in Italy, where art, science, engineering and technology came together as one. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci cannot be classified as artists. They were architects, engineers, artists and designers, and that eventually led to the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>Renaissance engineering program is a program in which students learn, not just engineering, but they understand other aspects of art, design, economy and it gives them an advantage as to what working for a Renaissance artist would be like.</p><p><i>So, this is like moving from a design-centric approach to a broader perspective.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Yes, it’s like a shift in narrative and a shift in effort. I mean, I go and teach what industrial design is. You might grow up to be leaders or heads of corporations, but you require someone to design a campaign, who to look for and how to use it. Similarly, economics is taught in a manner that it is useful for them, not as a subject. So, at the end of the day, they have a Capstone project which will combine all of this.</p><p>The Renaissance engineering program gives you a bachelor’s degree plus a master’s in management plus one year of studying in one of the best universities in the world. REP fellows are selected based on the capabilities to teach and lead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You co-founded Inovasia Design in Singapore and are a successful design entrepreneur. Keeping in mind the dichotomy that exists in society, how can budding entrepreneurs achieve middle ground and rise?</strong></p><blockquote><p>It can be achieved very well and effectively, when human beings are the heart and soul of your consulting.</p></blockquote><p>You’re not designing for the interest of the marketing; you’re not designing purely for the profit or for that the management that wants this product. You are designing it for the human being. If that is the central aspect of yours, everything else will fall in place. Focus on the user.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you want to design medical equipment, there are three people who will predominantly be the users. One is the patient, second is the paramedic staff, who takes you around, and the third is the doctor. If you design an equipment, the doctor may not want to touch it, for some odd reasons, they will touch it with a pencil. If you design a control panel, they’ll keep punching it and if it breaks down, I failed as a designer because I didn’t foresee this.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, the nurse will touch it. They will clean their hands and clean their equipment. Thirdly, if I am designing a medical product, I need to care for the patient, and I want to see his comfort. Moreover, he should not be intimidated by the display. What the doctor needs to know, the patient doesn’t. In movies, many times, the doctor would walk in and say, “Oh! The heart rate is 56, and it’s going down.” That’s the last thing the patient wants to hear. There should be a cautionary message that’s sent to the nurse and the doctor so that they can come and correct it. So, the design of medical equipment is multi-faceted. You come to the aesthetic of it. It should exuberate confidence. You don’t skip into a ward wearing a skirt.&nbsp;<i>(laughs)</i></p><p>You must be prepared for it. Similarly, a product with a thousand wires around it won’t give you confidence. We need to have foresight while developing. The nurse too, must know which coloured wire to press and which to put. Designers have traditionally had this mindset, colour-coding things so that they are easier to use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You interned as a student at the Sony Design Centre in Tokyo. How was your experience, and how did it help you evolve as a product designer?</strong></p><p>See, IIT taught me to be a designer of the Ulm School, where everything was very organised, and there is some structure to it but embedded with Indian ethos and culture. As a designer, I was confident in conceptualising and sketching and all that. At Sony, I realised that a designer has to have discipline. You are not an artist; you are a designer. Someone asks you to design a Sony Walkman. You have to know that there are two targets in mind. One, it has to be a saleable product, as defined by the marketing or as per your definition. Second is that this product has to be reliable, in terms of its mechanics, which is the art of an engineer but those two things have to come together in a usable structure that allows the user to know that this is the right thing I have and this is going to work correctly. Sony built its reputation on this very foundation. You are not playing games with yourself, but artistically you are playing a game, you are enjoying this moment. So, discipline is if I told you I’m going to submit it today, I will, because, for each delay, there are repercussions.</p><blockquote><p>I also realised that the product is bigger than yourself.</p></blockquote><p>Even if you’re designing a little hearing aid, the product is bigger than yourself. You cannot go out and show off that you designed a hearing aid, nobody wants to know. When they use the hearing aid, and they feel it has served its purpose, the look on their face, and the happiness that time when someone says you know what, Peer &amp; Partners must have designed this, that’s the goal. So, let the work speak for itself. You can always leave your signature, to say that I designed this, and people will find out. We never marketed Inovasia Design when we were in Asia, it was always word of mouth. The confidence our clients had in us was also very motivating. It is the calmness that my Indian education has brought to me and my professors who taught me.

The product is bigger than you, and to do that, we cannot rush to the destination, even if we have a deadline.

Mihir Ranjan, 2nd Year, EE captures the world from the perspective of the modern ghost, the silent observer detached from the social circles near him.</strong></i></p><p>And there I stood, watching over the rest.</p><p>Not in the dark, in today’s time the light or rather its absence wasn’t necessary to go by unnoticed. No one seems to mind my presence - as a matter of fact - neither my absence, as if my existence begs apathy. And I don’t mind that. We know a ghost to be an apparition of sorts, something otherworldly, manifested in our realm. And well, one could say that I am in many ways similar to a ghost. Not that I was a nebulous image here with malignant intent, rather I was disembodied from the machinations of modern society, the cog that won’t turn.&nbsp;</p><p>People are interesting, rather the things they choose to squabble about are. When you boil their psyche down to the very base, their workings are well defined, as if a universal law of human behavior pervaded this universe, quietly. Over the years, I learnt many things as I observed my peers. I wouldn’t call them new, since it's always about the same old droll and drama. It’s surprising how something so predictable can still be fun. Rather, I should say predicting things is fun, there’s a certain pleasure in playing the detective. A temporary high of being a puppet master, knowing the exact reaction to your targeted action. Socializing moved from being a necessity to a pastime, something to stimulate the senses rather than survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Living in the information age, knowledge is power, and I’m still to find the knowledge that could be more useful than the knowledge of the human psyche. Mankind is a social being, accept it or reject it, one cannot refute it. Since time immemorial, the definitive act of entertainment has always been social acts, be they festivities or feasts. The place where one feels at home is in the presence of others. In a civilization that survives around human contact, living without feeling an incessant urge to socialize felt surreal and to actually prefer it, supernatural.&nbsp;</p><p>Granted it leads to detachment from social circles, but that’s a consequence I accepted. One cannot be a ghost unless they’ve faded from existence.After all, one cannot be a ghost if they haven’t faded from existence.</p><p>I would not say I am anti-social, nor would I call myself an introvert. I am very well capable of meeting and bonding with new people. Just because I can, doesn’t mean I derive satisfaction from it. Once one breaks out of the system of common livelihood, and sees the day to day struggles of people, he naturally feels no inclination to partake in them. It became insignificant to me who said what about whom, or how the latest pop culture movie was. To be cognizant of the woes of the people and excluding myself from them. Was it my fortune that I avoided the problems of the 21st century? Or was it my curse to not experience this adventure as many before me had?</p><p>I never realized when I became the <i>modern ghost</i>, I don’t think anyone does. Between a quest for independence and a search for a greater truth, the lines of my reality blurred. As I moved from my life onto this afterlife, I take respite in the fact that there are many more to follow in my wake.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Illustration by Anirudh</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Illustration Credits: Tejasv Mohan</strong></p><p>There was a strange silence prevailing inside my room that day. The four-walled room seemed to be quite chaotic. The sofa, which was lying on one side and seemed to be pragmatically dark, was over-crowded with my bag, headphones and some books. The antique wooden furniture quietly tolerated its demotion and became a dumping ground rather than serving its real purpose. There was a jacket, which concealed my unfinished painting, illustrating my futile attempt to become a <i>Picasso </i>and also highlighting my relentless fervour of trying out new things.</p><p>The bed, which seemed to be a <i>space hogger</i>, surprisingly was very tidily kept with pillows and a colourful bed sheet which was a testament of my disarrayed and kaleidoscopic mind. The big round clock on the wall was constantly ticking and&nbsp; resounded in my mind, jarring out all the silence of the room. The vexed question of why the third hand of a clock is called a 'second hand' was gyrating inside my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>A warm yellow light with a hint of tangerine entered through the window, irradiating my evocative paintings, which outlined my desire to express my mind and emotions in a subtle way. The study table was cluttered with all the knick-knacks, evoking a sense of nostalgia. I looked at the mirror and pondered, ''<i>What must be its actual colour</i>?\" The room was congested but had enough space for my room of thoughts with multitudes of emotions flowing inside my mind.</p><p>The incidents suddenly transformed into a virtual reality game in which all my embarrassing moments, awkward scenarios where I failed to ‘prove’ my point appeared like different levels and were moving with a speed of 100 km per second. There was me, with the adrenaline coursing through my veins, with all the scenarios whipping my face like wind and I was trying to dodge them with my comebacks that I could have used in the real realm.</p><p>I suddenly realised that it's been an hour since I have been overthinking about the myriad aspects of my life.</p><p>The questions have started to consume my thoughts and teleported me to a world where I am contradicting my own arguments.</p><p><i>I constantly re-examined what people actually meant when they said ‘okay’, does that mean they aren’t agreeing with the point?</i></p><p><i>What about ‘maybe’, are they actually confused or just acting with their mind already made up and they just don’t wish to tell me?</i></p><p>I was trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind these simple words, which formed a perpetual trail of stress, fear, anxiety, and frustration where I logically crushed my own creative thoughts. The motivation and zeal to overthink somehow became obscure. Overthinking becomes obnoxious and I do realise this a couple of times and spend ample amount of time thinking about the ways in which overthinking can harm my mental peace.</p><p>For some, the art of overthinking&nbsp; is just a piece of threadbare cloth with torn and tattered memories which strikes discomfort and pangs of self-guilt inside one’s body. While for some, it is like a blanket of woven memories, which radiates expressions of love and warmth. It unfolds the countless layers of nostalgia which brings comfort and peace to the mind.</p><p>I sometimes feel that overthinking is not completely debilitating. We think of the happy and sad memories and relive the moments, which form a beautiful concoction of feelings, facts, opinions and some unspoken words. It completely depends on the way we choose to act and react in the situation. It somehow prepares us for the worst situation possible as we already have our ‘backup’ ready for whatever the situation may throw at us. We already may have analysed every aspect of the situation vividly, creatively and logically however trivial the possibility maybe.&nbsp;</p><p>What we need to learn is to balance this bittersweet art, which helps us indulge in reminiscence.&nbsp;</p>",

Well, let’s analyze:</p><p>The main boon and bane for sites like Tinder is the <i>option of choices.</i> If we could hire a time machine and go to the time when our parents got married, we would realise arranged marriages had some limited criteria for filtering out candidates.

The following <i>[3]</i> dilemmas might create small hiccups during your journey:</p><ol><li><strong>The Generic ‘Hey’ Text:</strong> Who would have thought that <i>hey impressions</i> would mean a lot more than first impressions? What’s a hey impression you ask? A relatively harmless text might set the mood for your whole conversation. Try to imagine it from the other side, it seems like you are creating a half parallel plate capacitor, “hey hey hey hey” arranged vertically on one side and it is figuratively drawing a picture of your love life- it’s just not working.</li></ol><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/asq1rE5KkGvHBKgR-4cR_6poTf-Wov4GYz4OPWjMKzCXnWBKufB7Gm4mElzhk-_lsZMz-330HJs_OYHiYG9Yaa3Ub-4eYbgD_YwFRAunauGFCMYR2mzJkIzwYwkopdTMIElVBebC\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>The Secretary Problem: </strong>This happens when both the parties are constantly going back and forth to settle on a date to meet up, but end up looking like secretaries who have their calendars absolutely booked. This leads to a fizzling out frenzy- the conversation which was once fun and flirtatious now turns into a <i>with-regards</i> email text. It is natural to go over the possibility whether the other party is even interested in you.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Grammar/Spelling:</strong> Even if you have a doggo besides you, a great body and the most chiseled face, I am sorry to inform you that, those might help you get past the swiping phase but you would never go beyond that. People, in general, perceive “uh are prettay” and “You are pretty.” as the difference in the number of grey cells you might have. Uh r definitely going 2 to get unmatched.</li><li><strong>The Infinite Loop of Swiping: </strong>You knew that we were coming to this. If no one swipes right, how the hell are you supposed to land up with your soulmate? You just reach the end of Tinder; it’s a metaphorical representation of Tinder giving up on you. What should you do next? Pack your bags, become an <i>avid traveler</i>. If you are able to score some pictures of yourself while meditating on the Alps, bingo! Also, go find a puppy.</li></ol><p>This list is just never-ending. To add to your misery, this list isn’t even the bible that you should be following. The acceptable slangs, your ethnicity, your lifestyle and if there is room for your education, might affect if a person would even consider you subconsciously in the first place. If you have the right skills to master the art of keeping a person engaged please start a YouTube channel and teach the world the hacks to master the<i> science of waiting</i>.</p><p>Online dating can/was/will never be enough. Even if you surpass all the phases and hurdles and meet the person in real life, don’t bind any expectations. Treat online dating as a rather introductory service. Just take a look, chat a bit and just meet the person before a pandemic takes over the world again!</p><p><strong>My final advice: Just don’t ask women if they would like to </strong><i><strong>“hang out”</strong></i><strong> with you.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Inspired by 'Modern Romance' a novel by Aziz Ansari with Eric Klinenberg</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>[1] Expert taken from the book.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>[2] Improvised expert from the book.</strong></i></p>",

Try to imagine it from the other side, it seems like you are creating a half parallel plate capacitor, “hey hey hey hey” arranged vertically on one side and it is figuratively drawing a picture of your love life - it’s just not working.&nbsp;</li></ol><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lNEpNTnyjSNeIEqP77tZR7Yi3Y52YSun5HwqNVJPHwEOgewEfNLoCV5R5HaGBsdxsx6rSC5FTYi7YNPrVYAAw2SQ4rg6K3Paono4eYBGxQJUZ0edp0EF4vShLIeldxmGPAk__bwb\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>The Secretary Problem: </strong>This happens when both the parties are constantly going back and forth to settle on a date to meet up, but end up looking like secretaries who have their calendars absolutely booked. This leads to a fizzling out frenzy - the conversation which was once fun and flirtatious now turns into a<strong> </strong><i><strong>with regards</strong></i><strong> </strong>email text. It is natural to go over the possibility whether the other party is even interested in you.</li><li><strong>Grammar/Spelling: </strong>Even if you have a doggo beside you, a great body and the most chiselled face, I am sorry to inform you that, those might help you get past the swiping phase but you would never go beyond that. People, in general, perceive “uh are prettay” and “You are pretty.” as the difference in the number of grey cells you might have. <i><strong>Uh r definitely going 2 to get unmatched.&nbsp;</strong></i></li><li><strong>The Infinite Loop of Swiping: </strong>You knew that we were coming to this. If no one swipes right, how are you supposed to land up with your soulmate? You just reach the end of Tinder; it’s a metaphorical representation of Tinder giving up on you. What should you do next? Pack your bags, become an <i><strong>avid traveller</strong></i>. If you are able to score some pictures of yourself while meditating on the Alps, bingo! Also, go find a puppy.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>This list is just never-ending. To add to your misery, this list isn’t even the bible that you should be following. The acceptable slangs, your ethnicity, your lifestyle and if there is room for your education, might affect if a person would even consider you subconsciously in the first place. If you have the right skills to master the art of keeping a person engaged, please start a YouTube channel and teach the world the hacks to master the<i> <strong>science of waiting</strong></i>.</p><p>Online dating <i><strong>can/was/will</strong></i><strong> </strong>never be enough. Even if you surpass all the phases and hurdles and meet the person in real life, don’t bind any expectations. Treat online dating as a rather introductory service. Just take a look, chat a bit and just meet the person before a pandemic takes over the world again!</p><p>My final advice: Just don’t ask women if they would like to <i><strong>“hang out”</strong></i><strong> </strong>with you.</p><p><i><strong>Inspired by 'Modern Romance' a novel by Aziz Ansari with Eric Klinenberg</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>[1] Excerpt taken from the book.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>[2] Improvised excerpt from the book.</strong></i></p>",

Gehna Sharma, 3rd Year, BAE writes about some common misconceptions about feminism.</strong></i></p><p>Feminist ideology is, more often than not, misunderstood, and opinions on its status quo seem polarised. Its broad objective is to attain political, social and economic equality for women; however, there is confusion surrounding its meaning and scope stemming from misconception and misuse. Feminists are often accused of being fuelled by anger and a desire to subdue; and consequently, some ‘extreme’ feminists are often labelled as a ‘<i>feminazi</i>’ or a ‘<i>pseudofeminist</i>’. While in reality, not all men are here to patronise, and not all of us understand feminism for what it truly is.&nbsp;</p><p>Human beings as a species have a proclivity for exercising dominion. Patriarchy is one such example of systematic oppression that can only thrive as long as the weaker are held subject to it. In its essence, feminism strives to bring all genders in conjunction to create a safe space where each individual feels respected while being given the same opportunities as the rest. As opposed to certain beliefs of a marginal group of people about completely shifting the concentration of power away from men and into the hands of women under the banner of feminism. Feminists rally for <i>gender equality, and </i>the first step in attaining equality is empowering oppressed women. Those who vouch for gender equality have iterated that feminism is not about putting women on a pedestal. It's about understanding others' struggles and giving them credit where it is due while upholding the integrity of each individual.</p><p>Millions of women continue to face atrocities by not just men but also other women and little attention is paid to their misery due to their circumstances or lack of support or both. However, we need to push the narrative forward that men’s issues aren’t any less important than women’s, especially vulnerable men who are subjected to brutality and are exploited relentlessly with little protection and become even more hapless from the lack of public admissibility and reporting of such issues.&nbsp;</p><p>An increasing number of people believe that feminists are here to radicalise the movement by threatening the equilibrium. They’re under the mistaken impression that feminists are determined to put women above everyone else, disregarding the rights and merit of men. One cannot deny that the misuse of any ideology to the benefit of one gender is prevalent. People in the past have used it and will continue to do so to justify actions and behaviour which are otherwise questionable. Both men and women have, at some point, been biased towards their sex either consciously or subconsciously. But, to be there for each other by including men in the conversation and not letting women get the benefit of the doubt every single time under the pretext of Feminism is a topic that needs to be given the center stage amidst all the rubbishing of feminist claims as male-biased and misconception of their objectives as those aiming at the vilification of all men.&nbsp;</p><p>Feminists do not wish to denigrate men, and not all men deserve the scorn or lack of space that they’re given for what it’s worth. To feel a sense of belonging and inclusion both men and women collectively need to persevere for instating gender parity.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>\"Wake up India, she's dead,\" said the headline of a newspaper, on 29th December, 2012. This piece of news set in action a long list of events to the path of justice, the outcome for which we finally get to witness 7 years later on <strong>20th March, 2020</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Jyoti Singh, Priyanka Reddy, Asifa- why do we know these names? Unfortunately, not because they worked hard and went on to fulfil their aspirations (which they were fully capable of doing) and made a significant impact in society, but because they were robbed of this very opportunity by being the victims of some of the most gruesome rapes that shook this country. These names aren't known to us because of what they did for us, but because of the gross injustice they had to go through.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone's heard of the statistics but of course, no one remembers them- they're just a bunch of women reduced to numbers through the trauma they go through. But still, let's take a look. Figures from the National Crime Records Bureau show that 33,977 cases of rape were registered in 2018 - that's an average of 93 cases a day. The victim could be a six-month-old or a senior citizen, there's no discrimination here. And these are just <strong>rape</strong> cases. <i>Registered <strong>rape</strong> cases</i>. We still have thousands of unregistered cases, hundreds of brides murdered for dowry, and a multitude of incidents of marital rape.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time there is some horrific incident like this, it's all over national television, in the newspapers, in our regular conversations- it's all anyone talks about. There are protests and rallies and furious people on the streets- for about a week. But then it all simmers down, people return to their daily lives, and it's the women who continue to live on with the residual fear of the gruesome incident that just occurred, thinking to themselves, \"That could've been me\" or \"That could be me next.\"&nbsp;</p><p>In the past few years, Asha Devi, the mother of the victim in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case, has become the face of the fight that stems from the frustration many Indians face due to an incompetent system which fails victims of some of the worst crimes. The hanging of the rapists is a huge win for her. Her patience and perseverance are commendable. Not only was she able to ensure justice, even though delayed, for her daughter, she fought long and hard to ensure that this historic day would come- the day women across the country feel safer. So that the loved ones of the girls in this country can heave a sigh of relief at the fact that there are people out there fighting hard to make this country a safer place for women. At least the barbarians out there will think twice before committing such heinous crimes. All this was possible despite the delay tactics implemented by the convicts and their lawyer till well into the morning of the execution day, mere hours before the set time for execution. But amidst the celebration of this feat, an important question arises- <i>Does this hanging actually make India a safer place for women? </i>The answer to that would easily be a <strong>no</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because punishments like the death penalty, no matter how harsh, are not effective enough deterrents. The only solution to this, as we all know, is a drastic change in the collective mindset&nbsp;<br>of people living in this society that treats women like property. But in a country like India where people are so set in their ways, it'll be a while for such a change to be fully implemented. Until that happens, how do we ensure the safety of half the population of India? By doing what we've always done- imposing restrictions?&nbsp;</p><p>According to the International Labour Organization, in developing countries, the lack of safe and accessible transportation is the most challenging factor for working women since too often, women risk facing harassment and even sexual assault on their daily commute. So, what do women do next to try and protect themselves? Give up on opportunities at work that demand them to stay back late because of safety reasons, thereby, restricting their career growth. What do government educational institutions do to ensure that their students are protected and no incident of this sort occurs when the female students are under their watch? Impose unrealistic rules and set a curfew so that the female students are confined to their rooms, again, restricting them. What do our parents do to ensure that their girls are safe and unharmed? Impose restrictions- ones that apply only to the girls of the households- restricting their freedom yet again. Because of course, <i>\"Who's going to harm the girls on the streets when there are none, right?\"&nbsp;</i></p><p>What we, India's women, want is less of political agenda, cosmetic outrage, and empty promises. What we want is to remove loopholes in the system so that no one has to go through such uncalled-for trauma. Writing some strongly-worded article or posting on social media doesn't make matters better either, these are mere outlets for those of us who're helpless, those of us stuck in their homes after 8 p.m. because their parents are too scared to let them out after that, to make our voices heard. But maybe someday, someone, somewhere will hear and pay heed to these voices. Someday, this broken system of ours will be fixed. Someday, we'll get justice- hot and fresh- not 7 long years later. These crimes may not stop entirely but when they happen, someday we'll see in our newspapers, \"Wake up India, <i>they're</i> dead\". Because this one hanging might not solve all our problems, but it sure as hell lit a fire that's not dying down anytime soon.</p>",

Firstly, <strong>theory classes will be completed by 30 April.</strong> We have requested teachers to organise practical classes online or using simulation if possible, so wherever possible, we would like to organise practicals online. If it isn’t in some cases, we are looking for alternative ways. Secondly, we are in the process of framing guidelines for evaluation. <strong>If the university opens this month, there won’t be a problem; </strong>we will be able to make up a lot of ground. But if it doesn’t, we have to look at the <strong>possibility of online examinations </strong>or evaluation of courses. So, we are working on that, based on international guidelines and what top universities of the world are doing. We are in discussion with such universities also. Within a week, we will have some guidelines for our teachers. So, <strong>those who are in the final year and pre-final year don’t have to worry</strong> about this; we will conduct their examinations online.</p><p><strong>In case the closure of the university is extended, is there a plan to extend the semester up to a certain date?</strong></p><p>Taking advantage of technology, if we are able to finish theory by 30 April, the only question that remains is that of practicals and projects. We have requested our teachers to give online projects to students. <strong>We do not want to extend the semester for final and pre-final year students. </strong>For first and second year students, we have not taken a decision as of today. Their classes will be over, for practicals some arrangements will be made online, and then offline when the university reopens. Everything depends on the date of reopening of the university. Students should not worry about this, we are taking care of everything, and all engineering and management<strong> final year students will get their degree on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Is the university providing financial support to the mess and sanitation workers, who are the first ones to get affected due to lockdown?</strong></p><p>We have released salaries to everyone, including those employed through outsourced agencies.

We have entrusted HoDs and faculty with evaluation in their respective departments, and they will certainly find a way.</p><p><strong>The grading of bachelors and masters projects was supposed to be directly associated with conference or journal publication.

We understand the difficulties, <strong>most conferences have been cancelled and some have been converted into online conferences.</strong> These are difficult times and special care must be taken, so we will explore all possibilities in the interest of our students. I request all students of Delhi Technological University to not worry, we all are with you, we understand everything, and we will take all steps under the limitations of rules and regulations to finish your semester on time, so we can start the next semester on time as well. Every alternate day, we are conducting meetings with HoDs and Deans, and HoDs are also taking regular meetings with faculty online. The faculty members take classes and are hence in contact with the students. There is no need to worry; the situation is not in our hands but from the university's side, <strong>we are taking appropriate steps to minimise damage wherever possible. </strong>We are very open to considering all suggestions from students as well.</p><p><strong>A week ago, AICTE issued a notice instructing all the affiliated institutes not to allow their students to go for internships outside their institutes.

But is socialism really all that noble? Ananya Kapoor, 1st year, EE analyses why socialism might not be the saviour it is often projected to be.</strong></i></p><p>As the United States of America elects its 46th President in November this year, there is one term - ‘democratic socialism’ - which has popped up in election-related discourse quite frequently.</p><p>Democratic socialism, as popularised by Senator Bernie Sanders, essentially advocates for a socialist economy working alongside a democratic political system of government. But what exactly is a socialist economy? In simple terms, a socialist economy is one which works by ceding the control of production and distribution of goods and services to the government. In turn, the government ensures an equal distribution of wealth and opportunities to all strata of society.</p><p>On paper, a socialist society seems to be nothing less than a utopia built on the admirable principles of equality and economic justice.&nbsp;But if the loss of Bernie Sanders to Joe Biden is any indication, a significant chunk of the electorate still doesn’t seem to be warming up to its ideals. Why is this so? Why would people reject a system that seemingly benefits all?</p><p>The primary reason for this mistrust lies in socialism’s innate belief that the government knows what is right for its citizens rather than the citizens themselves. Command economies, a permanent fixture of the socialist model, are a good example of this ideology. In a typical command economy, the state imposes checks on investment and production and takes ownership of all major industries, eliminating all competition from the private sector. The motivations behind this kind of economic system appear to be quite honourable, as it aims to meet the demand for all sorts of goods and not just profitable ones. It also checks profiteering by putting a ceiling on prices. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of these noble goals, this system ultimately ends up hurting the consumer by allowing monopolisation of industry and shortage of goods. An example of the disaster of nationalisation is the country of Venezuela which currently faces huge food shortages, blackouts, and even lack of medicines due to the bureaucratic control of all major industries instituted by former president Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Another aspect of socialism which has generated widespread resentment is higher taxation for the rich. Advocates of socialism often try to counter this sentiment by arguing that&nbsp; redistribution of wealth is the only way to create an economically homogeneous society. Though this approach appears to be prudent from a moral standpoint, it actually possesses many flaws, the foremost being that higher tax rates empower the state at the cost of the citizens by decreasing their economic freedom, something which goes against the very ethics of democracy. Higher taxes are also perceived as being hostile to entrepreneurs, who often outsource their businesses to other countries, leading to a loss in revenue. Economies with higher tax rates also see more cases of tax evasion as individuals scramble to use unethical means to avoid incurring the cost of taxation. However, the most worrying aspect of higher taxes is by far the fact that the socialist model almost always diverts them into populist measures like welfare schemes and subsidies, which can prove to be disastrous for economic growth.</p><p>At this point, the reader may wonder what exactly is wrong with welfare schemes. Aren’t they supposed to alleviate financial distress? The answer to this is that welfare schemes do alleviate financial distress - but only <i>temporarily</i>. In the long run, they lead to economic ruin. Let us see how.</p><p>In a typical welfare state, the government provides financial assistance to all people who are unemployed or earning below a certain threshold. In countries where a large chunk of&nbsp;the population lives in poverty, this requires a significant amount of financial investment which often comes from slashing the resources allocated to upcoming industries. As a result, the industrial sector fails to expand. This cuts down future employment opportunities and slows down the production of tools and machines. Ultimately, a stage is reached when a large section of the populace remains unemployed and depends on the state for subsistence, leading to increased deficits. The country also remains technologically backward.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the best example of a country exhibiting all the above trappings of socialism and none of the benefits is our very own - India. The history of socialism in India dates back to the Independence era when its ideology was aggressively championed by the stalwarts of the Indian National Congress, including Jawaharlal Nehru, who envisioned India as an ideal socialist republic. The government takeover of major industries and banks in the 1950s and 1960s was a major step towards the fulfilment of this agenda, and the blocking of foreign investment further consolidated the country’s position as a socialist state. A plethora of welfare schemes was also incorporated over the years, and income tax remained high, peaking at 97.75% during the 1970s.</p><p>Based on the promises of card-carrying socialists, by now, India should have emerged as a poverty-free nation with efficient industries and employment for all. But the reverse seems to have happened. Unemployment remains high, poverty refuses to release its grip on the nation, and state-owned enterprises have turned into bloated, non-performing assets. The high taxes which were inveigled out of the middle class have been funnelled into fiscally irresponsible welfare schemes, and the condition of state-run schools and hospitals remains as pitiful as ever. The only improvement this country has seen over the past few years has been a result of liberalisation and foreign investment.</p><p>So where does this leave us with regards to our original question? Does increasing income inequality warrant a comeback of the old socialist model? If we go by historical precedent, the answer would be an emphatic ‘no’. The&nbsp;list of failed socialist states is simply too long to ignore and acts as a damning indictment against socialism’s impracticality. It is high time we acknowledge this fact and move away from socialism’s destructive policies, otherwise the consequences of our naïvete could prove to be extremely dire.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Ankush Mangla, ECE, Class of 2019, who secured AIR 2 in Engineering Services Exam (ESE-2019), and is currently an ADST Grade Engineer.</i></p><p><strong>Can you walk us through the whole process of the interview, from the IES exam to getting posted?</strong></p><p>The IES exam is a 3-tier exam combining- the prelims, mains, followed by an interview. One can appear for the mains only after clearing the prelims. The interview focuses more on the current affairs and questions related to one’s personality. They give several case studies regarding social issues, and there is no scope of bluffing.</p><p>After clearing the interview, there is a training process of 78 weeks in which you are required to travel across the country. Currently, my joining date has been postponed due to the prevailing circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you focus solely on these competitive exams or you prepared for the campus placements as well?</strong></p><p>In my first year, I wanted to pursue post-graduation from abroad. However, I got an internship in my 2nd year with Samsung and then a PPO as well. It was then that I realised I didn’t want to work in a private sector firm. I wanted to pursue a career in government service. Consequently, I started preparing for the Engineering Services Exam and casually appeared for my first attempt with little hopes. I was lucky enough to have fared well in my initial attempt.</p><p><strong>When did you start preparing for this exam, and why did you prefer IES over other civil services?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t regular in my coaching classes, and my attendance fluctuated. I had to miss four months of classes due to my internship. I began preparing on my own. I used to study for 10- 12 hours on the weekend. I believe that self-study played a crucial role in my journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, the idea of becoming an IES officer hadn’t crossed my mind. After the end of the third year, I was truly motivated to pursue civil services. Being an engineering job, it involved a lot of technical aspects along with the management part. It has a very dynamic approach, and every day you are faced with new challenges to overcome. You can even switch to other civil services later if you wish. It is flexible in that aspect.</p><p><strong>How much do projects and internships matter when appearing for this exam?</strong></p><p>They don’t matter that much in the case of engineering services. But being a fresher, that is, appearing for the exam right after college and reaching till the final round gives you an edge over others and fetches you more marks. But at times they do ask about the projects and internships. So, they do hold some importance in the interview round.</p><p><strong>What kept you motivated throughout the journey?</strong></p><p>I would say I was not motivated initially. Since I had got the PPO, so there wasn’t any pressure on me. After September, there was nothing to do, and I had a lot of free time in the final year. So I decided to prepare casually for it, and I cleared the prelims. It was then I decided to study hard for the next round. Maybe clearing the prelims round was the motivation.</p><p><strong>What advice would you like to give to fellow students who aspire to pursue civil services?</strong></p><p>I feel that one should definitely have a backup option. Always prepare for the campus placements as well. When one is in college, there isn’t much pressure of clearing an exam, but once you enter the corporate field, it becomes difficult to manage the job as well as the preparation. So, one should judiciously utilise the free time available in college. The core mantra is to be motivated throughout the process. One should always have self-confidence and belief. There are ample opportunities and courses available on the internet. Keep a limited number of sources that you refer to, and revise multiple times to have a better understanding of the topic.</p>",

    "body": "<p>The 70’s and 80’s Bollywood was known for action, the <i>Angry Young Man</i> and the ever so stylish bell-bottoms. It was also known for melodious tunes, romance, and comedy, all of which had one person in common -<strong> Rishi Kapoor.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>He shot to fame with Bobby (1973), a love story which subsequently set his career with similar romantic roles. Coming from a highly respected Bollywood family, he had the additional challenge of proving his individuality which he duly did through his charming looks, versatile acting and his widely acknowledged affable persona.</p><p><i><strong>“Acting was in my blood and there was simply no escaping it,”</strong></i><strong> </strong>Kapoor wrote in his autobiography <strong>Khullam Khulla</strong>. Having spent his childhood on film sets surrounded by the film fraternity, there was nothing else that he wanted to do more than acting.&nbsp;</p><p>The manner in which he emoted the feelings of love and betrayal in Chandni or the humour and joy in Amar Akbar Anthony is unparalleled. While he played an incurable romantic in his heydays, he took on a diverse range of roles in the latter half of his career. From Akbar Illahabadi, Rauf Lala, Mr. Joseph Furtado to Veer Singh, Santosh Duggal, and Murad Ali Mohammed.&nbsp;</p><p>Most actors phase out in their twilight, but Rishi Kapoor fully embraced the changes and took on roles that added overwhelmingly to his illustrious legacy. He played a rogue don in D-Day alongside the brilliant Irrfan Khan and he also brought to life a disgraced lawyer fighting for his family’s honour in Mulk directed by the effervescent Anubhav Sinha, there is no doubt in saying that he did complete justice to all the characters that came his way.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>“Whatever the quality or outcome of the project, Kapoor’s output was unwaveringly steady and dependable, the shield of trust that came free with a movie ticket.” - Scroll.In</strong></i></p><p>Apart from his identity as a superstar, he was well known for his<i> bon vivant, </i>his exuberant personality and witty remarks. A complete family man, Chintu Kapoor’s on screen and off screen chemistry with wife and co-star, Neetu Singh has always been a spectacle to behold.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past few years, he had become an avid Twitter user and his camaraderie with his co-stars and fans was well documented. He never shied away from speaking his mind which was sometimes curt but never malicious.&nbsp;</p><p>A day after the loss of Irrfan Khan, Rishi Kapoor’s demise came as a huge shock to everyone who knew him. The film industry has lost a gem who will live on through his work which will continue to make us laugh and fall in love with life.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kPASqNHejgZXpqGKBUNXW_QXjecMSYy84BuuTZq7fjS-e2bC_bsT7tyB8yqhQFDPsRIY9R4SLHwTzPGwevAY_iBCLsASuXQzxM2apG407klUN6HjWJ2l5HOQCCqqj2xac2YVB7Oy\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>Illustration: Sourajit Bhattacharjee</p><p>Artwork: Shanal Bhele</p><p><i><strong>At the end of one’s life, all there’s left to ask is how much did one take from this world and how much did one give back to it.</strong></i></p><p>The long-standing debate on the separation of art and the artist is a glaringly accurate critique of a world where artists are pardoned for their monstrous behaviour depending on the work they’ve done in their fields. But then, there are always some performers who make the entire debate, the entire premise feel debased by the simple act of living their own opinion. Irrfan Khan was one such man.&nbsp;</p><p>Right off the bat, Bollywood is not an easy industry to be a part of. It’s rampant with nepotism, rigged film awards and the occasional PR stunts shrouded as celebrity feuds. The institution can very well be compared to a circus as it makes its performers walk on the tightrope of perfection in front of the audience, i.e. us. Amidst this process, it's exceptionally hard to retain professional dignity, and one’s personal responsibility to their art. Irrfan Khan was one of the few actors of his time who recognised this very early on. Instead of surrendering into the way things were, he took the decision to stay true to his work, his viewers and most importantly, himself. Fortunately, he exercised his power to sway the Indian audience towards real emotion, beauty, and grit; that is the true cinema.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>“I can't think of a more pathetic situation for an actor than to do a film and not connect to it. And I pray to God that I never face that situation.”&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>He used to frequently express his grief over the absence of a culture of realistic acting in India. Over the years, he felt that one of the biggest disadvantages of the commercialisation of movies was the betrayal of his definition of what the word meant to him. He felt that a movie must be emotionally and intellectually engaging; he felt that a lesser and lesser number of movies did that over the years. This belief of his can be seen throughout his vivid career, which redefined the meaning of versatility when it came to Indian cinema.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>“You cannot reduce the power of story with the tag of money because it's not a share market. So you must know the seriousness of the power of storytelling.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Be it an aesthetic marvel as Maqbool, a critically acclaimed gem as The Lunchbox or a heartwarmingly quirky journey as Puzzle; Irrfan Khan had a rare quality that helped him serve up to all his roles perfectly. His exceptional method acting was a result of his complete sacrifice of the self for the discovery of his character’s mental state. Because of his flawless technique and exceptional hard work, he could always induce a special feeling among his audience. One could watch him in a light-hearted comedy as Blackmail or along with Tom Hanks in Inferno and still feel that he&nbsp;<i>belonged&nbsp;</i>in that frame. In hindsight, it is difficult to fathom how one man can play both, a former puzzle tournament champion in one movie and a simple barber/family man in another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With time, his vision, humility and self-cultivated charm of a&nbsp;<i>Nawab&nbsp;</i>led him down a path of critical acclaim internationally. He was one of the very few Indian actors who regularly represented India in Hollywood. Cracking Hollywood is one of the biggest milestones that an Indian actor can achieve in his life. Even though Irrfan Khan had reached this pedestal in his acting career, he stuck to his roots and remained loyal to India’s film making. One such act of his was rejecting an opportunity to work alongside Christopher Nolan for Interstellar back when he was shooting The Lunchbox.&nbsp;</p><p>The details of his roles, his methods of acting are as astounding as they are unending. However, the tale of his life far exceeds the plot of any movie he has partaken in. The biggest role in any man’s life, actors included, is the one he plays from the moment he’s cluelessly dropped onto the world. As hard as it is to be a good actor - to be the epitome of retaining meaning into an industry that doesn’t appreciate it enough - it’s significantly harder to be a good person. To give yourself into your work, your discipline and yet not surrender your humanity in a culture that rewards it, is the mark of what makes his legacy as authentic as it is.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ownLIbH_kwcw8COWgxPU8xUdERSm8UgQ0T5W4j0nhgiOIZaVuNiKM2hMmcBcwz9gys6ucqQzVpX7I0HAn4-HyECVzlTo18dmbXwF-JsWVOpH-j7OxdSeXWkfJjft9GygDyxlIcfM\"></figure>",

    "body": "<p>Dear Class of 2020,</p><p>My calendar serves as a bleak reminder that just over a month ago we were making plans for the<i> ‘lasts’ </i>that we have to tick off the list before the semester ends, and now we don’t even know when we will meet next. Despite your best efforts to optimistically sugarcoat the heartache, I suppose by now most of us have come to terms with the harsh reality that this year, there will be no batch photoday, no week-long farewell, no last exam shenanigans and all the paraphernalia in between as leave without a flurry of emotional goodbyes, or teary eyed last photographs.</p><p><i>When we are graduating in such a numerically balanced year, it had to be particularly prolific after all.</i></p><p>For the past four years, most of us had pictured this exact moment, and even passenger-ed with our seniors who enthusiastically exalted about the last semester being objectively the best time of your life. All of us had mentally rehearsed the unfolding of the events of the last month, but perhaps your last midsem ended up being your last day in college, and your quixotic Goa trip probably never happened.</p><p>But what we do have with us, is a far greater appreciation and gratitude for the time we spent here. Regardless of this cold, unceremonious ending, our college years together have been nothing short of a dream — a dream full of late nights suffocated with haphazard revisions, loud nights immersed in indie music from someone’s borrowed bluetooth speakers in the hostel, intoxicated night(out)s drowning in the hysterical laughter over the same old joke somewhere on the streets of Delhi - nights that are now stories worth commemorating for years.</p><p>It seems like forever and a half ago when after the initial apprehension of first year, we discovered how this place carries an intrinsic charm with herself. Over time, things unravel like a montage of orchestrated chaos as she engulfs you in and marinates herself within you; slowly, and then all at once.&nbsp;</p><p>Au contraire, these days -&nbsp; they seem slowly sinking, wishfully reminiscent of the ones when every morning was an avenue into working with excited accountability, every day was a quest to quench the tireless thirst for fresh experiences and every night soaked in a gratifying slumber.</p><p>But now that anticipatory celebration is gone with no sight of closure, instead of receiving the space we need to overcome this tragedy, we’re pressured to fill our time with activity and feel guilty about our self-pity. We will have enough time to read books, make music, listen to podcasts, try cooking, and be better, but today — <i>today it’s okay to grieve.</i> And even though we may have to maintain six feet of social distance between us even after this ends, let’s allow each other more social space to grieve in the way we each need to.</p><p>Somewhere between the briefly comforting messages of <i>‘We are all in this together’,</i> we stumble upon some sporadic resilience; resilience which has been permeated with the proficiency in navigating through the crowd at Amul to find your friends; or accentuated by the perseverance perfected via 8-hour FIFA sessions followed by sleeping at the wake of sunrise; or ingrained through the patience cultivated while waiting for Chandan’s maggi; or the resilience which has been soaked in you while consuming the misery sprinkled in the mess food.</p><p>So, dear class of 2020, it has been nothing short of an honour learning and growing with all of you. In these past years, I have found the most passionate and ambitious people. Dreamers and doers. People who will never stop fighting for what they believe in.&nbsp;</p><p>In the distant future, we would be remembered as the ones who faced unprecedented challenges right before stepping into the<i> ‘real world’. </i>Having the infliction of being at the cusp of this inflection point, we will be a part of a new wave of problem solvers who will approach challenges in a radically different manner without taking future opportunities and relationships for granted.&nbsp;</p><p><i>gam zeh ya’avor -</i> because that’s the only inevitable thing we have as of now to hold on to.</p><p>Your fellow batchmate,<br>Shivam Jha</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Harshit Tanwar, ME, Class of 2020, who got placed at Daikin Europe N.V. as a Development Engineer.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What motivated you to opt for a career in the field of mechanical engineering?</strong></p><p>For me, it is really fascinating to understand how different mechanisms and components work and equally exciting to design them. I enjoyed designing components and applying different concepts of physics and mechanics to day-to-day life.&nbsp; Therefore, choosing a career in the field of mechanical engineering will provide ample opportunities to utilise my learnings in the company.</p><p><strong>How is the placement preparation for core profiles different from that of coding/non-tech roles, and what are some must-have skills for candidates?</strong></p><p>Placement preparation for core profiles is similar, in my opinion, to coding/non-tech roles. Preparation for language proficiency, Data interpretation and aptitude are the same in any profile you are looking for. The difference occurs in the technical section where one has to study hard, practice and go through a lot of questions in their respective domain.</p><p>Candidate has to be confident and must have excellent communication skills. It makes a huge difference when someone speaks proficiently and confidently at the time of personal interviews or GDs. He/she must go through every word of their resume because it is the only piece of information interviewers have about you before the personal interviews.</p><p><strong>Does being a part of a tech team/society provide you with an edge in the process?</strong></p><p>It does help to be a part of a tech team/ society. I was the team captain of Deltech Baja, and it has provided me with massive exposure and in-depth knowledge in the field of designing and an all-terrain vehicle. It also taught me to work with and manage a team.</p><p>Interviewers at the time of my interview kept on asking questions about the team, what we do, how we do it and different conceptual questions related to the domain they are interested in. If you have been a part of the team, then be prepared for answering questions on the department you were working for.</p><p><strong>What are your views regarding the increasing number of students interested in consulting/analyst and non-tech roles rather than pursuing a career in engineering?</strong></p><p>In my view, there is an increasing demand in the industry for analyst or other non-tech roles, which has resulted in students being more inclined towards pursuing it as they believe there are more opportunities for the same. But if anyone is focused and determined enough, he can get a placement in core engineering companies too.</p><p><strong>How much of a part did the academic curriculum of your course play for you in the placement process and to what extent does one's CGPA matter?</strong></p><p>Academic curriculum plays a supporting role in the placement process because oftentimes, a question can directly be asked from the subject that was taught to you. Although in one of my interviews, out of the book questions were asked about ‘HVAC’, something that has never been a part of our curriculum. Therefore, it is necessary to learn and understand concepts that are in depth and often not in the course.</p><p>A CGPA above 7 will get you shortlisted in most of the placement rounds of companies. Post this, it is totally up to you, on how well you have prepared for it. A low CGPA will not hinder you much as long as you have skills and knowledge to showcase and defend the reason for your academic performance.</p><p><strong>What would you like to say to your juniors who want to pursue a career in the core domain but are demotivated by the lack of placement opportunities in the same?</strong></p><p>If you really want to pursue a career in the core domain, then you will definitely find a way to land a placement offer. Do not get demotivated by the lack of core companies visiting the campus since there is always an option of off-campus interviews. The TnP department too, does a lot of hard work in inviting core domain companies. One should always keep trying, believe in one self and never give up.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Madhusudan Bansal, AE, Class of 2020, who got recommended for the Indian Army, Navy as well as the Air Force.</strong></i></p><p><strong>When did you realise that you wanted to join the Armed Forces after B.Tech. rather than taking the NDA route?</strong></p><p>My best friend, Krishna Lohiya, whom I met in my drop year, told me about the comprehensive selection process of SSB when he was conferenced out by the AFSB in 2015. Motivated by that, I took the NDA exam and appeared for the SSB interview at Bhopal in 2016. It was my first exposure to the military. The perfectly maintained lush green lawns, the unspoken discipline that everybody followed. I felt like I belonged there. Meeting boys from <i>Sainik </i>schools, Military colleges and listening to them talk about swimming, adventure sports and horse riding, I was excited to spend the next 4 days with them. I had already started imagining myself learning these activities in the academy. However, I got screened out on Day 1, and then aged out from the NDA entry.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next 2-3 years I met officers, who were serving or retired from the forces, through my relatives and friends. That gave me a real picture of what the Armed forces were all about; what they offered and what was required to be a part of them. I finally found strong reasons that encouraged me to join the forces- personal growth, adventure, and escaping the monotonous 9 to 5 lifestyle.</p><p><strong>What was your preparation strategy for the exam and the SSB Interview?</strong></p><p>Having cleared JEE, passing end semesters and aptitude tests at TNP, I think we all have enough strategies to ace any written exam. The real challenge was the SSB, with a selection rate of around 3-5% and many batches having zero selections.</p><p>It is said that the first step towards improvement is acceptance. So, I began to observe my behaviour, actions and emotions while trying to keep judgements away. This helped me become more aware of myself and my surroundings. I joined a Toastmasters Club that gave me a platform to speak my mind, working in and leading a team. SSB is not about reading particular books and memorising facts. Their assessment is based on 15 OLQs (Officer Like Qualities). My strategy was to understand their requirements and build those OLQs from within. Everybody has it in them. The trick lies in being able to present them in the right manner.</p><p><strong>What was the most challenging aspect of the interview for you? How did you prepare for it?</strong></p><p>The SSB is divided into three phases of assessment - Psychological Testing (<i>Manasa</i>), Interview Testing (<i>Vacha</i>) and Group Testing (<i>Karmana</i>). For me, the tricky part was to analyse my psychology and mould my responses in the way they sought in an ideal candidate. Some present their ideas impromptu and believe in spontaneity. I believe in practice, so I strategise accordingly. Writing stories, sentences, practising reactions and self-description was something I made a habit.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after my first recommendation, I continued working on improving the quality of my responses with my other defence aspirant friends. Evaluating each other helped us to identify gaps, come up with better ideas and keep the motivation high. The interviewing officer may even dig into intimate details of your life, including bad habits, girlfriends, biggest mistake, fears, weaknesses, regrets, etc. The best thing about truth is that you don’t have to memorise it. I am not that truthful, to be honest. I prepared for my lies, looked him directly in the eye and told him stories that I had rehearsed to support those lies. My father tells me, “<i>Speak the truth, always. But when you have to lie, do it with confidence</i>”.</p><p><strong>How was your overall experience of the 5-day selection process? How did you deal with the pressure involved?</strong></p><p>The overall experience depends much on the result. Once you get through, you stop thinking about the mistakes you've made, or the questions you didn't know the answers to. You stop worrying about the parts you messed up. Once you’re in, it becomes a memorable experience. You reminisce the witty answers you gave in the interview, the point in the group discussion that flummoxed everybody. Up until then, it's a lot of pressure, anxiety and mental exhaustion. You force a smile on your face, trying to make everyone like you, especially the assessors and your groupmates. The SSB is like playing a sport. The pressure is part of the process. You can't let it get to your head or reflect on your face. The trick is to smile through it.</p><p><strong>What suggestions would you like to convey to other Armed Forces aspirants of DTU?</strong></p><p>There is no defined path to crack the SSB. Some don't even prepare for it and get through and then wonder if it's something even worth pursuing. Some wouldn’t clear it in 15 attempts and some may do in their 18th. Though, I have observed that most of the recommended candidates have a similar thought process, similar value system and similar responses to certain situations. Some people just fit in the mould that the armed forces try to match us against.</p><p>I would like to say that don’t make cracking SSB the one and only goal of your life. Make the best out of all the opportunities that come your way. Having a solid backup will give you the confidence to face the result. We can't control the medicals anyway. Also, don’t believe anyone blindly, especially blogs over the internet. Find like-minded people and prepare in groups. Try giving constructive feedback to each other. Reach out to your seniors and don’t hesitate to ask for help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Prajya Sharma, Electrical Engineering, Class of 2015, who received admits for the MBA program from Harvard Business School, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Wharton (University of Pennsylvania) and Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern University). She has also received the Stanford Reliance Dhirubhai Fellowship, which is awarded to only 2-3 students in the entire country.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>What motivated you to apply for an MBA abroad against studying in India?</strong></p><p>Studying in a global business school, especially the top universities in the world has always been my dream. If you see the statistics in any of these business schools- above 40% of their classes have international students and they come from 150 different universities across the globe. Hence, the learning environment is quite progressive. The relationships you make, things you learn about businesses, governments and happenings across the world are quite intriguing. While the education system in India is great, I feel like we lack global exposure.</p><p><strong>Despite the shortcomings that we face in the Indian education system, what would you identify as the positive factors while studying in DTU that pushed you towards achieving these goals?</strong></p><p>The logical and analytical abilities we develop through our rigorous coursework and the challenging entrance exams and time management. These abilities come in handy wherever you are and not just in applying to B-Schools. It definitely helps in securing a good GMAT score and also in our professional lives. I also felt that studying in a good university like DTU&nbsp; gives you a great ecosystem - a network of peers who are driven and accomplished&nbsp; and a launchpad for your career.&nbsp;The progressive environment really eggs you on and pushes one to achieve more. Also while I was at DTU, I got a chance to explore and get involved in research projects, community initiatives etc. that were pivotal in understanding what career I want to pursue and bolstered my B-school application.</p><p><strong>You received an on-campus offer from PwC. How did that work experience help you charter your journey?</strong></p><p>Yes, I had worked for two and a half years at PwC. I was placed in the risk advisory consulting practices but that was not the profile I wanted. I wanted to work in the Energy and Utilities practice but at that point in time they were very apprehensive about taking girls in that practice. So, I eventually took the risk advisory role and after 8-9 months was able to move to E&amp;U where I worked on renewable energy projects across India and Southeast Asia. My work in E&amp;U built my foundation in the cleantech/renewable energy sector and gave me exposure to international markets and different work streams (policy advisory, business planning) and sub-sectors (solar, wind, hydro) etc. Needless to say, this diverse work experience helped me not only in getting job offers&nbsp; but also in distinguishing myself in my B-school application.</p><p><i><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>Be proactive and seek out opportunities and projects that are diverse, niche and give you a chance to be intrapreneurial and lead initiatives within your team/organization&nbsp; - this is what I did in PwC.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>How important would you say it is to bag an offer from a reputed firm, if one dreams of making it to Harvard or Stanford?</strong></p><p>It is NOT necessary to work in MBBs, other top consulting and IB firms to get into reputed MBA programs; however, starting your career in any top companies from any sector, say Fortune 500s (say <i>Amazon, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, GE, GS, JP Morgan </i>etc.) and global unicorns such as <i>Airbnb, Uber </i>etc.&nbsp; will give you an edge.&nbsp;</p><p>My understanding is that since these companies and consulting firms have rigorous recruitment processes, it serves as a checkpoint for the admissions committee - if a candidate was able to qualify for such companies, s/he must be a worthy candidate.</p><p>Having said that, I don’t imply that it’s not possible for the people who have not worked in these companies to get through. Look for differentiated work experience and the companies that are doing well in their respective domain - data analytics, fintech, impact consulting etc.. Things have changed now, there are a lot of admitted students who are also coming in with start-up experience. Many admitted students moved from consulting/IB to work in start-ups such as <i>UrbanClap, Ola, Swiggy, Rivigo, 1mg</i> etc.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Start your career in a reputed company. After 1-3 year, you can go for second jobs in start-ups, VC/PEs, policy, global&nbsp; not-for-profits etc.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>How would you say your experience in the social sector, both from</strong><i><strong> Engineers without Borders </strong></i><strong>and </strong><i><strong>WeRise India, </strong></i><strong>helped you in your application? Is volunteering a major chunk of the differentiating factor when it comes to applications?</strong></p><p>That’s a good question. The reason why business schools look at extracurriculars is because they want to know how you are as a person outside of work - your value and motivation, and if you are passionate about something to spend time on it after office hours.</p><p>I was in my second year when <i>Engineers Without Borders</i> was started by two of our seniors. It was a very low-key operation. The idea behind it was for us to use our engineering skills and design products for community development.&nbsp;</p><p><i>WeRise</i> is an organization that I started a year out of college to promote gender progressive behaviour among adolescents after having faced gender bias as the only female in the E&amp;U practice at PwC. We’ve conducted gender sensitization and menstrual hygiene workshops for disadvantaged youth in Delhi. Both causes were close to my heart and were backed by a strong rationale/story - i.e. a personal experience/discomfort that led me to drive positive change and that's why it reflected positively on my MBA application.&nbsp;</p><p>A 'cookie-cutter approach' to work for a large-scale NGO or a soup kitchen in hopes of a volunteering certificate does not work. Because it’s neither authentic nor genuine. Don’t volunteer just for the sake of it. Say someone is passionate about photography and s/he has a photography blog, has put up some exhibitions, or has helped out a few social enterprises with a photography project - this itself is a genuine way to showcase impact. Also, prioritize quality over quantity - work for or get involved in 1-2 activities but do it well and create measurable impact.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have also worked for </strong><i><strong>Invest India</strong></i><strong>, which is a not-for-profit under the Ministry of Commerce. How would you compare this profile with your job at PwC?</strong></p><p>It was a complete shift from my previous profile. After 2.5 years of working in the consulting domain, <i>Invest India </i>offered the perfect opportunity for me to diversify and work at the intersection of investing and public policy. It is an organisation registered under the Ministry of Commerce and offers a startup-like environment to grow. We were a small team of 80 people when I started, and I got an opportunity to lead multiple&nbsp; initiatives and&nbsp; work with private and public sector enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Would you suggest doing things that specifically tailor one’s profile, or pursue one’s passion and hope that coincidentally it helps with the applications somehow?</strong></p><p>I would suggest one to choose a middle ground. Whichever sector/career trajectory you are interested in (consulting, energy, data analytics, investing etc.), find job opportunities in the top few companies in that space. Find accomplished people who are working in that sector and follow their career trajectories as a reference to chart out your own path.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t be naive and just pick projects that you think might help to build your B-school profile as recruiters and admissions committees will see right through these;<i> be smart about these things</i>. In your career, always seek out international project opportunities, secondments, identify upcoming projects/teams/initiatives and get involved in building it, seek out promotions/increasing work responsibilities to show career progression, find mentors and build strong relations with managers/seniors.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give students aspiring to study at top international business schools?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I would suggest students utilise their time in university judiciously. Work in areas you are interested in and build something out of those experiences - do research projects, get involved in impactful community initiatives, maybe even start your own project/start-up/non profit, research about B-schools, talk to students and alumni and attend admissions events, find opportunities to intern/work remotely with overseas organizations/colleges abroad etc.&nbsp;</p><p>You are never going to have this time again so do something that makes an impact, but don’t neglect your CGPA. Stellar academic performance is very important - graduate with high honors. Also, give your GMAT in 1-2 years after graduating (don’t procrastinate and delay it till the very end) so that you can focus on building your profile and application in the time leading upto the application deadline.</p>",

She also received a placement offer from Google India and a pre-placement offer from Samsung R&amp;D Bangalore.</i></p><p><strong>How did you simultaneously prepare for the placement season and CAT? What was your thought-process while deciding these options?</strong></p><p>As I got an early PPO, I was lucky enough to be spared from the placement season. It is always a blessing to get an intern early in the season. The companies which come early give a higher proportion of PPOs, and also have a higher rate of acceptance of PPOs by students. This is, of course, the most ideal scenario. There have been times when I had more than one thing to focus on. Although there were relatively few overlaps, whenever I faced one, I tried to prioritize stuff and take-on one thing at a time. When you have to focus on multiple things and a number of uncertainties attached to your daily routine, it is better to plan flexibly and do whatever comes your way. It was usually not that difficult a task, but it did keep my hands full at times. The intention behind choosing both fields was a result of a dilemma- I wanted a career in one and also wanted to keep the other as a backup.</p><p><strong>What was your reaction after every achievement of yours? Did each of these change the definition of success for you?</strong></p><p>There's always a gradient to everything. You feel elated the first time, but gradually you realise that it's all too transient to be celebrated that hard. It's because once you get something you wanted, that moment of happiness flies away in a jiffy and things get back to normal. Gradually, you start thinking about the other things you have on your to-do. It makes you realise how elusive success is.</p><p><strong>What was the single most valuable habit that you think helped you achieve these laurels?</strong></p><p>I worked for everything as much as I could, and judiciously utilise the slightest bit of time. However, working hard is something everyone does; what's even more important is having a positive attitude and a constant belief in oneself– it helps you maintain focus.</p><p><strong>Now that you have done such a commendable job of securing prospectus offers, which one are you most drawn towards and why?</strong></p><p>I'm yet to figure out exactly, so I guess only time will tell. But yes, there is an inclination towards working for now, as coming back to software after doing an MBA is not possible, which is not the case otherwise.</p><p><strong>What was your lowest point while running in the rat-race for placements and entrance exams?</strong></p><p>There were quite a few times when it was stressful, but I was lucky enough to have some really amazing people around me to help me get through them. If I have to choose one, it was the time when I was just about to leave for my CAT exam test centre. We had our first end-semester exam the next day, and it had already been quite an eventful week. I was dead tired and broke down thinking of how I wanted that day to be, and how it was turning out to be. I was also thinking of all the gaps in my preparation and how I wanted to do it all again. But again, there were friends in the same situation much stronger than me, pulling me forward.</p><p><strong>What all extracurricular activities did you take up during these four years? What role did they play in determining your success?</strong></p><p>I was a part of NSS DTU and DTU Times. I received immense love from both the communities, and they really helped me grow as a person in very subtle ways. I got all kinds of exposure- ranging from understanding how things work in an organisation, to how to deal with people and work in harmony. They helped me build an amazing network of really inspiring people, including my juniors, seniors as well as batchmates. Handling responsibilities in such communities helped me believe in myself and played an important role in uplifting my confidence.</p><p><strong>What suggestions would you give to juniors who are sitting for internships or placements this year? What is the best way to practice and how should one formulate his or her plan?</strong></p><p>Placement and internship seasons are very unpredictable. Your company tests will test your knowledge, whereas the overall process of landing up an opportunity during the season will test your mental strength. Hence, it is important to work on both these skills. Everybody gets what they deserve sooner or later. One needs to be patient.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the question of laying out a plan, I would suggest some pointers to keep in mind. It is important to be aware of the kind of preparation required, what is asked in company tests/interviews, resources to study from, platforms to practice on, etc. It is best to seek guidance from your seniors and branch PCs. Work out a plan accordingly with set deadlines. This goes for both tech and non-tech. Decide upon your resources and then practice religiously. If you are a beginner, don't worry; start from scratch, gradually increasing the difficulty level of the problems.</p><p>Build a strong resume with good quality projects. If you're worried about your projects, be aware that you still have time, and talk about the kind of projects you should take up with your seniors. Your resume should be well worded, properly indented and presented. Try and get it reviewed by a senior, if possible. It is crucial as your resume speaks volumes about you. Work on the soft skills that'll help you speak about what you know. Soft skills include your way of addressing an interviewer, way of communication, confidence, etc.</p><p>Since times are uncertain, try to stay calm and not let the negativity affect your mental health; try not to overthink about the impact of the crisis on your future. Everyone's in the same boat as yours, and the uncertainty might go on for long. In such circumstances, building your skills is all you can do right now, and if you let the crisis play with your mind, you might lose out on productivity. Stay focussed, stay calm!</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>What are some of your insights on making more visually/factually appealing presentations?</strong></p><p>The presentation skills of both the approaches are different from each other. The western talent focuses more on the practical skills. The strategy firms, business giants want crisp data, they mainly look for the skill of accommodating multiple data on a single slide. The presentation must be precise, informative, with crystal clear points so that it has a proper story line which one can go about. One can take ideas from presentations of the top consulting firms such as Accenture, BCG etc, and by incorporating their suggestions and ideas one can ace a presentation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Professional fields such as Data analysis, Data science is something a lot of students wish to pursue as a career. LinkedIn has numerous people with certificates of data science which somehow saturates the job opportunities. How can people make their profile stand out in order to get through the competition?</strong></p><p>There is a stream of people coming up with the same courses but this is how the real talent can be filtered out. The real courses which are actually given weight-age are the courses which have a long duration of 120 hours or so with regular exams so as to test the knowledge of the person.&nbsp; In order to have an edge over others one should aim for the courses which are real, which makes one test their skills. Posting a certificate on LinkedIn does not make you stand out. Knowledge is the key. One should only post about something he/she is confident about and has a grip over it. One should also emphasize on posting research works and technical projects so as to make one’s LinkedIn profile stand out. Being a part of interesting projects will differentiate oneself from the larger set of audience. If you have relevant coursework and a strong GPA— add it to show what you’ve worked hard for. Adding causes and volunteer experience is a great way to round out your professional identity. Almost half of all hiring managers say they view volunteer experience as equivalent to formal work experience.</p><p><strong>What is your take on cold calling especially in today’s scenario where COVID-19 has minimized the job opportunities in all the sectors? Do you feel that there is a change in the job trends now?</strong></p><p>The job trends have surely changed due to the current scenario. Job opportunities have been minimized and one should be well versed with technology at this point. I don't feel cold calling is the right approach to reach out to recruiters. One should not diminish their talent and should not fall into the trap of getting a job, one should be thorough with the decision and evaluate it patiently in order to come up with a plan. It is always better to wait rather than hurrying into a decision. I myself waited 3 months before joining a management consultancy because I wanted to be thoroughly equipped&nbsp; with the best skills be it presentation, excel or advisory. One should exactly know about their passion and be properly aligned with the correct thought process to make one’s growth and productivity efficient.&nbsp;</p><p>Research the profiles of alumni who inspire you and track their LinkedIn timeline to see how they got from the university to where they are now. Don’t be shy. Reach out and ask to hear about their path, advice, tips. One thing to make it more productive is to be polite about it, be professional and exhibit an interest in their interests. Finding a common ground with them would help your message stand out among the dozens of messages they may be getting everyday. Growing your network this way opens up opportunities and shows employers you’ve made an effort</p><p><strong>There are a lot of students who don't wish to continue their engineering career and rather go for coding or business consulting related jobs. How can they make their profile stand out considering the fact that their interest and their degrees won’t be showcased in the same alignment? Will it cause any hindrance?</strong></p><p>It is a very common scenario that the students don’t find themselves aligned with the course they are pursuing and eventually wish to change their career paths and there is absolutely no problem in doing so. The effort, the skills, the research and the proactive approach is what matters. Companies today hire people from diverse backgrounds. Even if a person is doing Mechanical engineering but has exceptional coding skills, he/she can definitely work for a technical firm irrespective of the branch. One should just be confident in what he/she is doing.&nbsp;</p><p>The optimal number is unique to each person. Include a mix of high level and niche skills and be specific. Get Endorsements -Add skills that your connections can endorse you for and recognize those you’ve worked with on their professional skills. There are over 3 billion endorsements given to date on LinkedIn. Take advantage of the loads of information LI has to offer. Also on company pages you can see who has a job you might like and could follow them. You could also set up job alerts in order to further curate content to your liking. To sum it up, you can use LinkedIn to your advantage only if you learn how to do it by putting in time regularly.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn stands out as a popular professional platform. What differentiates LinkedIn and makes it exceptional?</strong></p><p>One thing which makes LinkedIn stand out is it’s member driven approach. It keeps people engaged on a professional level. The trends, the statistics, the insights which LinkedIn provides helps an individual as well as an organization to expand their networking. The data and the tools which LinkedIn offers is what binds the family of 690 million people and makes the platform standout.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If we were to broadly categorize three types of professions, like the split of our subjects we had sciences, commerce and the liberal arts. Is LinkedIn is in any way biased towards any of these disciplines, and how are the experiences of these different disciplines?</strong></p><p>In LinkedIn, there isn’t any one stream that dominates. Nowadays, there are more bureaucrats active on LinkedIn, and we have more commerce students and medical students nowadays. The experiences are different, if you are from an engineering background, you are expected to be passionate about something in line with engineering, be it technology or strategy. There are obviously cross links, but as an audience people generally have a mindset approach towards these. Every person wants to fit in different things in their profile and get the edge over others, obviously if you are the last student to get interviewed you need to leave an impact.</p><p>A lot of people still get away with the one page resume, but nowadays more people are looking at LinkedIn profiles since it is a standardized format. No one has time to read a 100 CVs, but in LinkedIn you can glance at it and get an idea of their work experience in under a minute. Try to get into groups because they give you exposure to industry professionals that you wouldn’t see otherwise. You can learn about new roles that way. There are many ways for you to share what you know on LinkedIn, and to also learn from others who are sharing their expertise.</p><p><strong>In every university, there are people who are at similar levels in terms of knowledge and skills but they aren’t on par in terms of communication skills, how can these students make more out of their degrees and maximize their potential?</strong></p><p>Students from underprivileged backgrounds can utilize resources like LinkedIn learning, which are short, self explanatory courses of around 45 minutes teaching these soft skills. How to work on your communication, how to work on a presentation, how to dress up, the life skills which are essential to help people evolve. Back in BITS Pilani when I had a question, I had a doubt in my mind that I should only ask intelligent questions and what the class will think of my question. But I had the notion that any question is a question, that’s why students should learn these skills through these platforms.</p><p>Simultaneously, It’s not just about being on LinkedIn, it’s about using it strategically. Show off your talents and get noticed by hiring managers and recruiters. Go deeper with volunteer experiences to demonstrate skills, experience, and personality. Add project samples, such as images, documents and videos of your work. Add your skills and experience, but more importantly show them your unique path and personality.</p><p><strong>Do you have any final words from your personal journey for students of our age?</strong></p><p>I have a personal target of connecting with 2 new people, and for that I reach out to 10 new people. I don’t always meet the target, but I definitely do work for it. If I want to reach a person, I’ll work towards getting to know him and what he is doing, which panel discussions and conferences he's attending, what articles he's writing etc. Once I get a rough idea, then I have my bullet points on which points I am aligned with. When you approach someone and discuss their work over a course of months, they appreciate your attention to detail towards their work, it helps them know that you’ve been invested in their journey and further sparks an interest in them to be invested in your journey. This will help you establish a bond with them right from the very start.&nbsp;</p><p>You must look at people and see them, not as a professional on LinkedIn but as a fully-rounded person with interests outside the sphere of their professional work environment.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>Remember how you were sitting with your friends having the time of your life and then suddenly&nbsp; fell quite as the conversation hit a topic or a note you felt uncomfortable dealing with? It’s relatable, right? Well, you’re not alone.</p><p>We're all spending every second of every minute of every hour of every day thinking, our thoughts like passengers on a train, each registered fleetingly as it moves past the train station that is our mind. One thought blends into another to give way to another and so on goes the train of thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>It is easy to seat a few of these thoughts, they fall into place effortlessly because they are called for, reached for, even seeked and are therefore not troublesome. The real trouble arises when we try to accommodate those that never bought a ticket, the thoughts that were uncalled for, that vapourised out of thin air and that we have no idea what to do with.</p><p>These thoughts are narcissists, they feel important and so they disrupt and destroy everything else around them. All the well-seated thoughts are yanked off their seats as these <i>'Mawalis'</i> make place for themselves bullying all other thoughts into submission. And so, when the train stops at our mind's station, they're all we see in all their negative and toxic glory,&nbsp; these uncalled for thoughts with their <i>lathis </i>and weapons out, prepared to hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>And news flash about our masochist tendencies?&nbsp; We let them.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it is because we're too weak to stand up to them and say no, or maybe because we feel we deserve the hate and the hurt, but we let these thoughts house in our mind, to camp out at the station and stay, like the guests we dislike so much but don’t have the courage to stand up to and say “Leave.” This is where the problem lies. We refuse to acknowledge what's bad, we refuse to heal what's broken, we let it be and we keep pacing ahead in life, carrying the unwanted weight in our minds.&nbsp;</p><p>In our own fancy mental constructs, it is brave to move on. Extremely brave to ignore and escape all that hurts, to not deal with them and walk on in life. And while that works for the less troubling<i> Mawalis </i>that get bored of the inactivity and leave the station in search of more thrill, the real sinister ones are unaffected by this constant motion. We're left with thoughts, issues and emotions we bottled up, that gnaw at our insides constantly, wounding us in the process. They become an unwelcome and untreated part of us.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on is, thus, too often romanticised for the worse. It is seen as brave to just let go of a matter and keep walking forward and onward and it's true, moving on is good, but only after we've given resolutions a shot. Our ignorance and our tendency to bury our feelings altogether stops us from that. We act as if any signs of weakness are sins and so we hastily put them out of sight, put on a brave face and go on and about with our lives and by doing this very thing, we create our very own demons, or in this context, our <i>Mawalis.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Resolutions need space, they need time. There is a certain negative image that is associated with not being in motion that needs to be broken. It's completely fine to move on in life and get on with other things but it's also completely fine to stall and take our time. It is completely fine and equally brave to deal with our demons, to drop down our weapons in this war that we wage against life and just sit down for a moment and contemplate even the necessity of this war.&nbsp;</p><p>It's about time we take some time to focus on our healing. Afterall what do you do when you get physically wounded? Do you take some time to treat the wound or do you continue running off like a chicken even if causes you discomfort?&nbsp;</p><p>Life is tough even without these <i>Mawalis' </i>constant interference and so every once in a while, it is fine and even fun to go off the \"normal\" roads-most-taken and figure ourselves out before we get back in to finally fight off those <i>Mawalis </i>with a strong bollywood hero front.&nbsp;</p><p>That's one important action sequence that can wait to be awesome!</p>",

His baffled mind couldn’t make any decisions, his futile attempts to understand his own thoughts rendering him numb and cold. Staring at those distant tracks, he spotted a tiny glowing light and heard some&nbsp;raucous shrieks which heralded the arrival of the chugging train. The flickering reflections of the train's lights amidst the fog appeared like a ray of hope, a ray which transformed all his dreams and desires into a train that came rambling towards him.</i></p><p>This was a scene from the iconic movie <i>MS Dhoni - The Untold Story, </i>a movie&nbsp;which successfully managed to set a benchmark in the world of Indian cinema and won worldwide applause. It extensively unleashed the potential of its lead actor. The time for the fulfilment of the dreams of the reel life MS Dhoni - Sushant Singh Rajput - had come.&nbsp;</p><p>From being a National Physics Olympiad winner to securing one of the top ranks in the AIEEE exam, subsequently getting admission in one of the most prestigious colleges in the country, Delhi College of Engineering, his academic achievements were exemplary. However, he decided to quit engineering and soon made his television debut. Rajput paved his way through one of the most challenging, nepotism-driven industries of the country - Bollywood. He set remarkably high standards through his awe-inspiring performances and the choices of the films he acted in. His dynamic debut in <i>Kai Po Che</i> is the embodiment of how sheer talent and hard work can make one achieve all the success in life.&nbsp;</p><p>His raw talent swept the industry like a hurricane. He left the public awestruck and mesmerised by his performance in the MS Dhoni biopic. Be it a lighthearted comedy such as <i>PK,</i> an emotional, nostalgic story like <i>Chhichhore, </i>or a powerful narrative like <i>Sonchiriya, </i>the choices of such myriad classics showcase his versatility as an artist and as a performer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sushant vividly portrayed his creativity through his Instagram handle, inspiring thousands of young minds. One such fascinating post was a picture of his bucket list, which enumerated a series of stunning and inspiring events. He explored the infinities of space and the scintillating stars through his telescope, yet always kept his feet firmly on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>He checked off many of the items on his bucket list, which included visiting his alma mater Delhi College of Engineering. The memory is still fresh in the minds of the thousands of students who happened to be present in the college that day. It was a tense Sunday morning, with nervous faces anxiously revising their notes and virtually anticipating the grades which they would be getting. However, Sushant completely altered the vibe through his dynamic demeanour and charismatic personality.&nbsp;</p><p>Be it reel life or real life, he never failed to enchant his audience. His sudden demise has left us all horrified, creating a void which will remain hollow and unfilled. He has taught us the most crucial life lessons: the importance of love, hard work, faith in one’s dreams and most importantly, the brevity of human life.</p><p>The film industry has lost a precious star, a soul who with his outstanding performances illuminated the cinematic world and paved his way to the big screen. The avid stargazer concluded a beautiful journey and commenced on a new one, a journey where he now illuminates the boundless sky, scattering his sequin starlight like embers of a dying fire, winking and smiling at all his fans; for within their hearts, he shall always remain the number one star.&nbsp;</p>",

Read on as Anoushka Raj, 2nd year, ENE, Artika Sharma, 3rd year, ENE and Pratiksha Pradhan, 2nd year, ECE delve into the deplorable scenario of mental health facilities in the country.</i></p><p>The year 2020 has been synonymous with disaster. With a raging pandemic in place, it has left us all consuming content at the speed of light. The most recent tragedy in the list of the never-ending catastrophes that this year continues to inflict upon is the death of our beloved star and one of DTU's most renowned super-seniors, Sushant Singh Rajput, which almost every DTUite is struggling to deal with.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, Sushant Singh Rajput’s death is more than just a misfortune that struck Bollywood or the loss of a brilliant actor and a household name. It has served as a catalyst to get a country of 1.3 billion to finally open up about issues like mental health and depression. His suicide has served as a much needed wake-up call: we need to step up about mental health. It serves as a reminder to Bollywood, and to us, that mental health issues have always existed and will continue to exist if the current scenario does not undergo drastic improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>Wherever you go on the internet, the narrative about Sushant's suicide and mental health seems to follow you. No one wants to stay mum anymore and everyone has something to bring to the table. While it is a first for quite a few of us who have kept our struggles hidden from the world, and a seemingly 'baby' step towards normalising the treatment of mental illnesses, some popular ideas that are currently being propagated are a tad troublesome.&nbsp;</p><p>We see people quoting his entrance ranks, his good grades, his beautiful girlfriend, his movies with social messages, and his inspiring Instagram posts, and the first question they ask is: \"What could have gone wrong in the life of a man who seemingly had everything?” It is also the only narrative that seems to concern the media. But there's something very inherently wrong with this question and mentality. It seems as if it's hard for us to dissociate the idol we found in him from the human being he really was.</p><p>What is important to realise is that our identities are more than just monetary successes, the people who look up to us for our achievements, and the struggles that we go through. Sure, these are important factors and everyday things that keep us going, but being at peace with ourselves, above all, is what gives us the ability to live with ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Why exactly is it problematic for us, as people who never knew the real Sushant, to ask questions like \"What went wrong?\" whilst focusing on the most visible and material idea of success? Is it our outright insensitivity, or the temporary high of associating ourselves with a deceased celebrity?</p><p>Our idols aren't the superheroes we make them out to be. They're flesh and blood and bone, just like you and me. It's crucial, hence, that we focus on the right questions, questions that focus on what we can learn from this, and most importantly, how we can prevent others from facing the same fate.&nbsp;</p><p>The primary step is to normalise the idea of seeking professional help. Therapy is a lot more than a cup of warm chamomile tea and listening to inspiring podcasts. Sadness is a multifaceted evil that affects everyone in different ways. For some, it is days in a blacked-out room without food; for some, it is overposting on social media; for some, it is a huge bucket of fried chicken eaten mindlessly over a daily soap; for some, it is a bottle of pills that provide temporary relief; and for some, it is a combination of all these. Depression cannot be quantified or compared. Those suffering from depression, thus, need scientific diagnosis and treatment which only professionals can provide. It is important to understand that you are not your own diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p>The help further needs to be coupled with support from loved ones and constant reminders that they are not alone, which brings us to the second idea that is often misunderstood and glorified: the idea of being there for someone. “Being there” doesn't equate to solving someone's problems or curing them of their illness. You can be there for someone as they take their steps into a therapist's office, by their side, telling them that it's okay to not be okay and it's okay to do something concrete about it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can play more concrete roles too, of course. You can listen to them vent their hearts out, or hold them as they cry, but the question to ask yourself before you take the onus of sticking alongside a suffering individual is, \"Are you truly capable of being emotionally available for another human being?\" Check up on yourself first and ask yourself if you are capable of listening to them without your judgements and biases blinding you. Are you prepared to deal with the dark thoughts they might share? If the answer to these questions is 'no', then for the sake of your own mental health, please don't offer that kind of help. You cannot, after all, pour from an empty cup. Not only would it harm you, it would affect them as well if you suddenly withdraw yourself from the situation. Be there for them, but decide upon a level of involvement you can deal with and stick to it.</p><p>To do something for the cause, we have to be more proactive than just sitting and waiting around for people to come to us with sorrows that are eating them alive from the inside out. It needs to be more than just social media appearances of goodness; it needs to be a constant process of understanding, listening, changing, and knowing when to draw the line.</p><p>There is this another common misbelief associated with therapy - that it is for those who suffer from psychosis, hallucinations, or have some oddity that has consumed their brains. This school of thought needs to be nipped in the bud. The proactiveness that the Indian community shows while turning up at the physician, asking for antibiotics to cure a common cold overnight, is the exact seriousness and caution that this society needs when it comes to seeking help for probable mental disorders. The longer you wait to treat an illness, the more it spreads, till it plagues and torments you to the extent that quitting life seems less arduous than living through the pain.&nbsp;</p><p>It is about time that help is made accessible to all. Therapy needs to be available, not just financially, but also emotionally. We need more counsellors who are objective and virtuous, and we need more institutions who help promote the importance of mental health.</p><p>It is tragic how conversations about mental well-being stir up only when a celebrity dies. We need constant dialogue in all communities, educational institutions, workplaces, and above all, families. A conducive environment that promotes communication is the need of the hour, or we will end up losing more and more promising individuals. Grief can no longer be commemorative. We need action from the citizens, and the willingness to be kinder and more understanding. We need to be told that the solution to improve one's mental health goes beyond “meditating” and “choosing to be optimistic”. As long as we don’t recognise trauma as a medical illness, we cannot progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Sushant was one of the few extremely talented yet grounded artists to make it big in a predominantly nepotistic industry despite coming from a very humble background. He was self-made in its truest essence. There is no single way we can fill the void that is left after his passing, but the one thing we can do is to be better and to do better.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that journalists and media houses have the audacity to paint someone's tragic loss as a \"Masala\" story for the Indian audience to consume and discuss during dinner, while ignoring the underlying mental health issues that led to it, show how far we are from seeing suicide for what it really is: the ebbing away of hope and loss of willpower to fight with what's killing you. We're instead too busy playing the blame game, sometimes calling Sushant weak and cowardly, and other times abusing those around him.&nbsp;</p><p>Sensationalising his suicide by presenting assumptions as facts is an insult to the memory of who he was, the legacy he’s leaving behind, and most importantly, the unthinkable grief consuming his family and loved ones. Invading the privacy of a bereaved family by showing images of the incident isn’t just journalism gone wrong, but can trigger a trail of copycat suicides too.</p><p>Mental health discourse in this country needs to reach out from our bright white mobile screens to our living rooms, where we feel uncomfortable talking about our problems, to the hospitals where mental health specialists are still not found, to governments that have never given it due recognition, to friends who brush off signs of mental illness as attention-seeking, to the counsellors that misdiagnose and get away with it, and to educational institutes and workplaces who take it as a sign of weakness and associate it with disinterest or unwillingness to cope up with the workload.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to stop this cycle of hate and negativity that we're perpetrating. We need to stop pointing fingers and start holding each other's hands to come out of it together, stronger as a community. On a personal level, we need to look out for ourselves and those close to us, and the cycle will continue to create a chain of love and care.&nbsp;</p><p>Let the memory of Sushant stay fresh in our heads as a cry for help that wasn't paid heed to, and so let's pay heed to the thousands of other cries that we can hear but not listen to. Let's not inadvertently drive more people to the edge of committing suicide, and let's ensure they get the help they deserve. Let's be there for each other, and above all, be there for ourselves!</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Ananya Bajaj, 4th Year, IT and Harshit Meena, 4th Year, IT on their experience of giving online exams amidst the ongoing pandemic.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How was your experience of giving an online exam in such a situation?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: Initially, I was hesitant but all of our issues were resolved within an hour. So our experience, on the whole, was pretty good.</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: In this situation, online exams were the need of the hour. Our department provided us with a platform where we could give our exams and get our degree on time. All the students, faculty members, HODs and the Dean were really supportive. Many meetings were conducted on Google Meet about every possible issue that students could face while giving the exam. They provided us with a demo and all the issues and feedback were later sent to the authorities and were fixed on the same day, so that no one faced any issues on the examination day.</p><p><strong>Did you face any difficulties while giving the online exam?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: Personally, I did not face any issues and the process was quite smooth. One of my friends did face a slight issue but those were also resolved really quickly. Our teachers as well as the support staff were on time and were attentive to all our calls. Everything was resolved at the earliest. Moreover, one of our teachers set up the same test the next day with different questions to make up for the slight issues faced by my friend while taking the test. Mostly everyone was fine with the whole process. There was a rule that we had to login within fifteen minutes in case of a power cut. Even so, I don’t think any of us faced any problems.</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: I faced an issue in my third exam. My video camera was not working and was showing a black screen. The proctor told me to login again and start the test and in the meantime, I got a call from the respective faculty asking me if there were any issues to be resolved during that time. There were no disruptions in the examination process and the test picked up from the same place I had left it. So, basically it was all fine.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OizaKXn-LoEk1xCfm4YYtrReoU8j130zNP4kiyQDiudE-LWMK7u9uZ_CyZ7XeWENWMKxeaIkzzMQ2h45d-tIXmVO8z5NzeJkubqNOuia7j5Vll5YfXppnSoZwbSQ2R42kUbDYEAt\"></figure><p><strong>What was the situation like for students from lower financial backgrounds with poor internet connection? Did DTU take any provisions to make the exam process easier for them?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: Yes, they did. After the exam, all the students could report any problems, which included people in Kashmir who don’t have internet access.&nbsp;They were informed that they could give the offline exams later in case they performed poorly due to any issues while giving the exam. They have the option of giving a re-exam in July or August, when and if the lockdown lifts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: The students living in Jammu and Kashmir were given the option of appearing for the exam in a government organization closest to their homes, for example, police stations. For people in Delhi who were facing technical issues, they provided a personal cab so that these students could give the exam in the university itself.</p><p><strong>At the end of the day, do you feel that the online exams were easier or tougher than the offline ones? How would you compare the two?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: It takes me two hours to reach college if I was travelling from home, so that time was saved. On the downside, I felt that you had to read between the lines to be to solve the MCQ questions. This made the online exams slightly more challenging.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: The biggest advantage of online testing is that it saved me a lot of travelling time. Usually, it takes me one and a half hours to travel to college from my house. That time was saved in online examinations. I just logged in ten minutes before the exam.</p><p><strong>Would you like to give any tips to students who are yet to give the exam?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: You should try to not move your head too much, otherwise you may get a warning. Other than that, you should study well and try to read between the lines.</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: My tip would be to ensure that your connection is stable and that you have checked everything beforehand. Your laptop and Wi-Fi connection should be working correctly on the day of the exam. It is also advised to stay stable on the screen.</p><p><strong>Which mode of examination do you prefer, online or offline?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: I would prefer offline mode but again, online was equally good. It is quite difficult to choose. Offline has an upper edge because we get time to freshen up and we’re in an environment where everybody is giving the test. That is the only thing better about offline testing, though online was pretty good for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: I would say online mode is more preferable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you adopt any different preparation strategies for the online exam?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: Yes it was a little different. In the case of subjective exams, you tend to go through the content without actually reading between the lines or focusing on minor details as it is a majorly theoretical paper. But for the MCQ tests, we had to make notes and keywords for the important terms. We looked for and practised MCQs online as well.</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: It was basically the same strategy. In an offline exam, you don’t really need to be very thorough with the material and can give the answers in your own words. But in the case of MCQs, you need to be very specific. You also need to practice a lot of MCQs beforehand to be prepared for the actual exam.</p><p><strong>Do you think that online exams should be adopted as a viable alternative to offline ones?</strong></p><p><strong>Ananya</strong>: Overall, I feel that offline exams are much better because they provide a much better environment and don’t need an in-depth study of the topics. I think our preparation during online exams had to be two-fold. We were not only studying from the books but were practising MCQs from the internet too. That is why I would personally prefer offline exams.</p><p><strong>Harshit</strong>: Online exams are a do or die situation. You either know the answer or you don’t. In offline exams, you get marks for diagrams and even for just deciphering the question. But in an online exam, you need to know the correct answer beforehand. There are no grace marks involved. So in the long run, offline exams would be much better.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Taking a break and sitting in the balcony during a fine summer evening, I found myself battling with a nagging question. As I saw scores of people loiter around on their usual business and with the country returning to unannounced normalcy, my mind questioned, \"How does humanity manage not to fall apart after all that has happened so far?\". The present year needs no introduction, for its reference is enough to send jitters down one’s spine. A lot has happened during the year, with the exception being the thin line of sanity and chaos, trespassed multiple times. It is then prudent to assume that such an occurrence of events would traumatise any strong soul, let alone the regular human soul. Why then, do we see a sense of indifference inside the populace? Is it ignorance? Is it submission to fate? The answer is, it is neither.</p><p>As implausible as it might seem, the human grit does not seem to falter!</p><p>There’s this absurd thing about failure - it seems daunting when we first imagine it, baffling when we near it; and agonising when we encounter it. However, having faced it, we see the hope of succeeding. A year ago, if we had thought of the possibility of a pandemic derailing the entire world, we would have been haunted by it. Come March, if we had thought of the possibility of Covid-19 not disappearing within a few months, we would have been appalled. Yet, here we are, living through a health-wrenching pandemic as if it were just another one of our daily affairs. This is the potency of mankind’s moxie! Whether it be a once-in-a-century global health emergency or a war, humans are somehow always able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, digging through it even when it seems impossible!</p><p>The human grit does not seem to falter. When we allow our grit to face our failures, it is only then that we achieve true subjugation over it.</p><p>Such is the idea presented by Rahul Raj Singh, a DCE alumnus (2002, Civil Engineering), who in his upcoming song, “The Purge”, has radiantly conveyed hope to society in these dire times. The song has been created to uphold the belief in providence - faith in a belief that from this purge, shall emerge, a messiah to lead the World on, to once again become a safe, healthy and peaceful place!</p><p>Rahul’s journey has been a unique one as he completed his engineering, and consequently his MBA, finally rising in the corporate world to head the India Business of an American Consulting company; before immersing himself entirely into his passion for music production. Having learnt to play the guitar, while at DCE, his music had to wait a couple of years as he started his corporate career after MDI Gurgaon. The passion for music continued alongside demanding corporate roles; as he setup a small home studio and learnt music production. His collaboration with the new age music company GrooveNexus led to the production of his first song. The song will be available at <a href=\"http://www.groovenexus.com\">www.groovenexus.com </a>on 3rd July, 2020.</p><p>In his current repertoire, Rahul handles all aspects of music production from penning down the lyrics to composing the music, to playing the guitars and even lending his own voice.&nbsp; His latest song strives to become the beacon of optimism for people in such trying times.</p>",

Faced with job losses and uncertain finances, they find themselves staring at an extremely bleak future. Fortunately, organizations like Delhi's Guardians have stepped up to the challenge. Read on as Ananya Kapoor, 1st year, EE examines the unique role played by Delhi's Guardians in generating employment for the ones worst hit by the pandemic while also providing high quality, affordable sanitation services to the public.</i></p><p>It is almost universally agreed that in all of recent history, few events can match up to the scale and disruptive potential of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Within a span of a few months, the world as we know it has changed, perhaps permanently. The closure of workspaces, malls, and restaurants, strict stay-at-home orders, and economic growth plunging to its lowest levels in recent times does seem to constitute a scenario straight from a cruel dystopian universe. One of the most pressing concerns regarding the pandemic has been its impact on the job market. As corporations and small businesses institute mass layoffs in a desperate bid to stay afloat, an already stressful period has turned into a financial nightmare for many, the worst hit unarguably being the ones at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Over the past few months, as the country has been jolted by disturbing visuals of a veritable exodus of migrant workers, the possibility of a sustained unemployment crisis has become almost impossible to ignore. With many traditional channels of employment like restaurants, gyms, and hair salons becoming obsolete, there is an urgent need for these jobs to be compensated in order to provide gainful employment to a vast subset of our society.</p><p>At this point, most of us have realised that this pandemic is not something that can simply be wished away. The return to economic stability and employment generation can only be possible if we take a no-holds barred approach towards combating the virus. Luckily, this is not as difficult as it appears to be. Simple steps like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and regular sanitisation have been demonstrated to greatly reduce the spread of the virus. Sanitisation becomes doubly important in the case of patients who have been advised to home quarantine as it reduces the risk of transmission to their loved ones. Large workspaces also benefit from this practice as it diminishes the risk associated with a large number of people working in the same area. But with sanitation services charging extravagant amounts for even single-room accommodations, vast swathes of our population have been deprived of even this basic service.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, organisations like Delhi’s Guardians are working diligently to plug this gap. An initiative started by four budding entrepreneurs who possess degrees from eminent institutes like DCE and IIM Calcutta, Delhi’s Guardians is committed to providing affordable sanitisation services for a variety of spaces in Delhi, ranging from 1 BHK apartments to large office areas. Their noble approach of completely foregoing profits and only charging for the equipment used has reduced sanitisation costs to one-third of those charged by others. All this is done without compromising on quality, since the team only uses high quality chemicals approved by the FDA and WHO GMS along with hospital grade PPE equipment while performing their job. All professionals have the Aarogya Setu app installed on their phones and the team is WHO certified. Apart from the provision of affordable services, Delhi’s Guardians has also done its part in providing work to those who have seen their employment opportunities dry up during the pandemic. Their team includes restaurant and salon workers who have lost their jobs in the past few months but are now earning wages comparable to or even exceeding their previous ones.</p><p>Within a month of its establishment, Delhi’s Guardians has already received sixty orders from clients ranging from homeowners to commercial enterprises like the Bank of India. The team isn’t stopping here though. They are already planning an initiative to provide employment to the Madhubani painters of Bihar through the production of masks. This unique approach of helping disadvantaged groups become self sustainable micro entrepreneurs will go a long way in protecting the most vulnerable sections of our populace from the vagaries of the unpredictable job market.&nbsp;</p><p>Delhi’s Guardians’ sustained efforts in providing essential services while generating employment deserve our whole-hearted appreciation and support. Kudos to this crop of&nbsp;new-age heroes!&nbsp;</p><p>The Delhi’s Guardians team can be reached on their <a href=\"https://instagram.com/delhisguardians?igshid=40ov2hd1go91\">Instagram page</a> or on their <a href=\"https://www.delhisguardians.com/\">website</a>.</p><p>Delhi's Guardians is also providing special offers to DTU students as well as their family members. Their services can be availed through their website.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>DTU Times interviewed Anmol Vishwakarma, Class of 2016, ENE, a Ph. D. Student in Civil Engineering at Virginia Tech for the DTU Times Podcast.</i></p><p><strong>Please tell us a bit about your background. Where did you do your schooling and what were your JEE attempts like?</strong></p><p>I was born and brought up in New Delhi. I have three siblings. My father is an Electrical Engineer and my mother is a homemaker. My elder sisters are architects. I had an early exposure to engineering because of my dad and my sisters who were gearing up for architecture school and so, my decision to study engineering became pretty natural. I attempted the JEE twice. In my second attempt, I did get a rank but it was not good enough to land me the better IITs. I was relying on the AIEEE to get into DTU. My rank in AIEEE was right on the border and during counselling, I had the option of Environmental Engineering, Polymer Science and Chemical&nbsp; Technology, and Biotechnology. I was lucky enough to get my first preference. I still remember how happy I was when I got through the spot round. My family was travelling that day, but I had friends who had already enrolled there. One thing I would like to point out is that I chose Environmental Engineering in DTU after talking to some alumni. Most of them were very successful. I thought that I could follow their path, but this is where I see a vacuum. When it comes to the niche branches, like Environmental Engineering, there are not many people who can give you a clear picture, especially when it comes to the technical side. Most alumni you will meet are more into Consulting or IT fields and this creates a bias in the minds of students. In my four years in DTU, I also faced something similar but I have seen a growing number of students who are passionate about this field as well.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that Environmental was your first preference during counselling. Not many people coming right out of high school would be aiming for Environmental, primarily because what they know from their coaching and their seniors is that the current placement trend is more in favour of coding and circuital branches. A lot of people even take up core branches due to the availability of government jobs. In such a scenario, how would you justify the preference for Environmental Engineering? How can any other JEE aspirant do the same?</strong></p><p>Well, my rank in the AIEEE was pretty borderline so I didn’t really have the option of core branches. I basically had to choose from amongst the three “bottom” branches. If I had the option, I would have also chosen a branch based on the previous cutoff trends. All the same, I’m really happy that I chose Environmental Engineering. Also, there were some students in my batch who chose Environmental Engineering despite having a really great AIEEE rank. It's all about how focused you are and how much you have thought about it in the past. 90% engineering students are directionless and they come to college looking to get the best out of that opportunity.</p><p><strong>How did you tackle the pressure that comes with Environmental Engineering, especially in the first year when there is an inferiority complex associated with it? In the first year, when you interact with new people, the common point of conversation is about the rank and the branch.&nbsp; People ask whether you have actually chosen the branch or landed up there. It does pervade into your mind till the end of the first year and even the fourth year when it comes to placements and the cutoffs and eligibility for various companies. According to you, how should an Environmental Engineering undergrad navigate the inferiority complex and negativity associated with this branch at DTU?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, what you say is very true. I personally did not face something like this because the friend circle I entered into was very diverse but I still get what you are trying to say. In my opinion, such a thing shouldn’t matter because a lot of us don’t exactly know about the branch and the opportunities it can give you for anything. Nowadays, whenever I open the newspaper or read an article, I find that anything and everything is probably related to Environmental Engineering and can be solved using it. For example, water and the air-related problems in Delhi happen to be related to the core aspects of Environmental Engineering. According to me, we should not pay much attention to the negative aspects and focus on what we can contribute towards society. That is where the mentality shift is needed. This is basically a cultural thing and I believe that if people from DTU or other good environmental engineers come up, we could get some very good role models to look up to.</p><p><strong>Could you tell me a bit about your involvements in college? What societies were you a part of? Ultimately, how did the overall experience help you in your masters applications?</strong></p><p>First, I would like to go back to my first semester when I got admitted in the spot round. The biggest challenge of getting through the spot round was that the midterms were in the very next week after I joined. I wasn’t really getting awesome grades and it also reflected in my final mark sheet. After that, I ensured that I passed every exam and improved my grades. I did get some good internship opportunities later in firms like IOCL and Havells. These were not on campus opportunities but the work culture and deliverables in these two internships were really good. Regarding societies, I was a part of the Solaris group. I was working on their corporate and PR side. The concept of Solaris was really impressive. Other than this, I participated in ‘Engineering Without Borders’ and also other very basic stuff for the societies. Still, most of my work came from the internships.&nbsp; I think these are especially on the basis of research opportunities like technical writing. I would also like to stress the importance of the projects to get hands-on experience. These were really important points that helped me in navigating my journey through DTU. This is when you really know whether research interests you or not!</p><p>People should not be discouraged by working in environment opportunities. Even I was not very confident at first about getting into this, but then we soon collected a lot of quantitative and qualitative data from nineteen different parts of Delhi which we later analysed using computational and experimental methods during this process. So I really started getting interested in the computation side which usually deals with building models and analysing data. Environmental engineering goes hand in hand with data science. We need someone with domain knowledge to analyse the data. So you basically need to understand the importance of this field. It took me around three years, three to four internships, several classes and project work and some volunteer work to be able to find out something that interested me. Basically, the message I want to send across is that it is okay to be clueless about what you are going to do but you need to make an effort to try out different things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Could you briefly highlight something about DTU Solaris? I believe that a lot of students haven't heard of it, especially the students who have joined the college after 2016 or so. Is there an opportunity along similar lines or a similar team to create something like this? What are the student level competitions in this domain that students need to target and how can they go about it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Environmental engineering was previously dominated by mechanical engineering. After coming to the US, I have seen many opportunities in the environmental sector, like designing a water recharge facility within a city. They give you problems which require creative and innovative solutions, while also serving the public and conserving resources. Projects in this field are very case-study based, like in MBAs. The competitions held are very industry-specific. If there is a private industry, it might encourage research and collaboration with other industries. Some treatment projects have environmental engineering principles behind them and refining these six or seven processes can basically solve problems throughout the chain. An example could be of water coming in with pollutants and cleaning it in an environmentally sound, technical as well as creative way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does one discover about these opportunities? How does an undergraduate student find competitions that are happening out there. If someone really wants to excel in this domain, what are the skills they should have before tackling any of these competitions?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That’s a really great question. There is the KWWA site for US-based competitions, which is at the national level. There are separate ones at the state level which organise most of these activities and scholarships. As for skills, I would like to mention that it depends on what kind of subdomain you are looking into. The major subdomains you have in environmental engineering are water engineering, wastewater engineering, air resources, solid waste management and sustainability and policy. Robotics has also revolutionized the industry in many cities. The skills of any kind of research are disciplinary skills. You have to be interested in what you do. I would like to recommend a course called “Learning How to Learn”, which is all about learning mechanisms and trying to build chunks of knowledge and creativity. Certain programming skills are also needed. These are essential skills that you need to have. Things will be interdisciplinary in the future, so that is where everyone should be headed. Of course, this applies even if you want to work in the industry, because no two jobs are the same. Focus on your passion and your interests.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that your specialization deals with the computational side of environmental engineering. Basically, how Data Science can be used to help and generate inferential results to actually make an impact on our environment. So, how did you come to identify that this is the exact specialization you would like to pursue a Masters or a PhD in? Was it your coursework at DTU, your internships, or your major thesis?</strong></p><p>The answer is actually all of these. We had coursework on wastewater infrastructure. When I was applying for my Masters, I didn’t know that I would be going into the water infrastructure domain. That is the area I’m currently working in. I’m trying to develop risk and life cycle economic models for the water pipeline infrastructures in USA. We are using data from 500 different water utilities- it’s a big data problem. We have to develop different statistical models. So, that kind of analysis is very computational. I knew I wanted to work in this area because computational work really interested me. So, when I was applying for Masters, I applied to different professors who were doing research in the computational domain. Based on the responses I got, I chose the best one. I thought that if I got a fully funded Masters, I would definitely do my PhD because then it would be less of a financial burden. When I got my fully-funded Masters, I thought to give myself one year to understand this research area and decide whether I really what to get into this or not, because PhD is a long commitment. So, I gave myself one year and then told my professors that I was really interested in taking this further and doing a PhD in this area.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You mentioned that you’ve done a couple of significant internships. When it comes to finding internships in the core domain, it becomes extremely difficult if you don’t have a referral or an inside contact in the industry. And when it comes to on-campus opportunities, not a lot of core companies come in. So how should one find internships in reputed firms, and what exactly sets your applications apart when it comes to applying as an undergraduate for an internship?</strong></p><p>I would like to stress on the fact that it’s really important to improve your networking skills right from the start. Because I’ve seen that even after coming here, it’s harder for Indian students to leave that mentality of placements. Even here, companies come for campus fairs, but they just come to introduce themselves and talk to you. So, that is where you need to shine- you need to have the personality, communication skills, and networking skills. If you have a good rapport with your professor, you can go ahead and ask them, and they will help you find some good internships. Usually, applying online might not be the best way; I would recommend emailing and following up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When did you decide to pursue Masters and not an M.Tech. in India? How did you go about preparing for the GRE exam? What would you say is the weightage of GRE as opposed to your application? How do you make a strong application that has a chance of acceptance into the top universities?</strong></p><p>Right from the start I thought that if the education at the B.Tech. level is not able to give me the kind of an exposure to know more about the research side of things or what the industry is like, then doing an M.Tech. here would be the same thing again. So, I thought that I should get a different kind of exposure from a foreign university because their curriculum is very different, they’re more advanced, they have more research opportunities and better labs. If you’re looking for funding, it’s much better to come here as a Master’s student of Environmental Engineering as compared to that of Computer Science due to lesser competition. Initially, I wasn’t planning for Master’s. During my initial years at DTU, I was planning on getting an MBA. That is also a great path for Environmental Engineering students, especially from the perspective of environmental entrepreneurship- which we desperately need. While preparing for CAT, I realized that I wasn’t ready for an MBA. I had to study more environmental engineering and get some research experience. However, my CAT preparation helped me to quickly grasp the GRE material. I started preparing for the GRE in my 4th year. I got a Magoosh subscription, which is a question bank of relevant questions. Once in a while, I would give a full test from different content providers like Kaplan and Princeton Review. I found that the Kaplan tests were the most realistic. For the verbal section, I used the free Magoosh Android app. Anything above 165 in Math and 155 in verbal should be considered safe. I would really recommend the book Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis. I would also recommend everyone to develop a daily reading habit. I would really recommend The Hindu and The Indian Express editorial sections.</p><p>When you take the GRE, you’ll realize that the application process has just started. Find someone with a US news subscription, and use the data to prepare a spreadsheet to understand the different fee structures, rankings withing your domain, and research budgets. Choose 4-5 dream schools, 3-4 moderately ranked schools, and a couple of safe schools. I would recommend choosing schools from the Top 30 list. I have also found that State schools have better funding mechanisms as compared to Ivy Leagues. The next step would be do find a good combination of people to write letters of recommendation. Start early, and have at least 4 people- three professors, and one industry professional. You should have this finalized by October end, so that you can aim for early deadline colleges.<i> </i>Also, write your SOP on the side and get it reviewed. One point to note is that Indian students are acclimatized to being humble, but you must sell your strengths through the SOP. The selection process happens through two steps- first, the graduate school looks at your application and forwards it to the department if your GRE and TOEFL scores cross the cutoff.<i> </i>The departmental selection committee really looks into your application. Your essay gives an insight into how you are as a person and how you fit in. For people in Delhi, they should definitely take advantage of USIEF (United States-India Education Foundation). They have scholarship opportunities, and host a number of workshops to help you with your application.</p><p>Another aspect of the application procedure is getting the transcripts. You just need to go to the admin and ask them for however many copies you need. So, the application process is long and filled with challenges. So, start early, set your own deadlines, make friends along the way.</p><p><strong>How important would you say it is for a person to have pursued research into their core domain in their undergraduate studies if you wish to pursue research further as well? Does it have a significant impact on your application selection?</strong></p><p>Even if you’re not planning to pursue research, I would highly recommend everyone to pursue any research opportunities. They give you the push to practice theoretical thinking, literature review, and technical writing as well. In India, we’re not really taught to think of plagiarism. But schools abroad take this very seriously. Research experience make you aware of this. It teaches you to synthesize, paraphrase, and write coherently. Publishing papers or attending conferences definitely sets you apart from other aspirants. I didn’t have any publications, but I had presented my findings from my research in an international conference. So, that definitely helped me move forward. You can actually experience the process and know if that’s something you want to pursue in the future. Undergraduation is really the best time to explore your options.</p><p><strong>How would you differentiate between an undergraduate degree in India and a postgraduate degree in the USA? What tips would you give a person completing their Bachelor’s from India, and then going abroad?</strong></p><p>Since you invest a lot of money, you will be very serious about your Master’s. The teaching methodology is very different. They put a lot of emphasis on being creative and having your own answers. You are given an honor code to sign after each assignment to ensure that you haven’t copied it. And people follow it. That’s the difference in the teaching. You need to adapt and accept it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How was the experience of doing an undergraduate degree from India and a postgraduate from the USA? What are the differences when it comes to coursework? How serious is the faculty, how do you submit your assignments, study for your exams? Basically what are the inherent differences in education in the US and India? How does it change when you move from a lenient aspect of a B. Tech. life to a very serious, course intensive Masters degree?</strong></p><p>I would like to say that the teaching methodology is very different, they put a lot of emphasis on creativity which is definitely not the case in India. There is a lot of trust that is given to you here in the form of an honour code for submissions and people follow it. It's basically the kind of cultural difference that you need to accept. It will be different, you will have to work for your assignments. Another big difference here is that there is a lot of focus on presentations in the US. In India most of the marks you get are from tests and assignments but here you have to do more presentations, team based projects, write/critique research papers. You can’t take any shortcuts here basically. But other than that, Indian students are really good with communication there in contrast to the Chinese students who face a lot of language based issues. Mostly we have been exposed to their culture by cinema and it certainly helps in getting their references and get along. Apart from that, I think it will be easier for an Indian student to get adjusted here because the infrastructure and the environment supports you in every way. If you want to study, you’ll be given high speed wi-fi with a clean studying space, there will always be enough books in the library, you’ll have access to all research papers online through your college portal and library website. They will make sure that you have all the resources you need for an optimal educational experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Say if a person is not entirely sure about having a research based career and going completely into academia and if someone really wants to switch into the industry after their master and their PhD, what are the connections available in terms of the industry connect terms? How hard/easy is it for a person specifically in the environmental branch to shift to the industrial domain after their education? How do you get into those R&amp;D rooms?</strong></p><p>There are different options available for people who want to work in the industry like Apharm and Jacobs, these are very good consultancies. So they can provide you a variety of roles including analyst and consulting roles. You can go ahead and join water utility which will give you a lot of on ground experience as designers and jobs which are more implementation based than others. There are other possibilities as well to join policy development companies, for that you really need to change and structure your degree in a very specific way. The usual technical posts like designer and engineer would be less beneficial than courses like policy, systems and management related courses. So that is for industry and management positions. For academic positions, of course you can have a lot of research jobs within the industry as well. Even one of our professors is working in the industry as the research director in a firm. So you can go decide to work in the industry and come back to academia per your choice, a lot of my professors here came back to teach here after their work in the industry. There’s a lot of synergy and collaboration happening so you can probably end up in a research position as well. But those positions are offered by some bigger firms that have the resources to invest a lot in their R&amp;D department.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When it comes to financing your education in the US, because the finances are definitely a barrier for some students when it comes to people who wish to pursue Masters abroad but are unable to do so because of the lack of funding or the lack of scholarships so how does one try their best to secure a scholarship from one of these top universities? And if not a scholarship, then what can help you reduce that financial burden when it comes to pursuing an expensive degree abroad?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So first of all, I would recommend you to know the difference between private and state universities and their tuition fee structure as it is very different. So for example, Columbia is an Ivy League university but might charge you upwards for 60-70 lacs an year whereas a state university like Virginia Tech. If you just compare environmental engineering, Virginia Tech is a better school but Columbia of course is an Ivy League school. So Virginia Tech charged about 40-45 lacs when I got in here. But that was the 1 year fee including all costs whereas it was 70-80 lacs for virginia tech. So try to understand that difference and what you can afford realistically. But of course, if you want to get research assistantships, I would advise you to be very persuasive, very persistent. Even in your application process, when you’re writing an SoP, you should take a very careful look at your SoP because that’s what helps you get scholarships. Try to apply within their funding deadlines which are usually 15 days prior to their final deadline. So getting a good GRA would be based on how much passion you can show for one area of research and you cannot lie about that. If you are really interested in the field and have researched enough, you can write that you want to work in that lab or you can write that you want to work with a certain professor and they would definitely send your SoP to that professor for consideration. There is no cheating in that process, they really want to hire people so your SoP does go through the proper channels and then they decide if they want to keep you or not. Whether they provide you the funding initially or after the first semester is completely the professor’s jurisdiction. So I had 2-3 conversations with professors from universities I’d gotten admitted into. So they could have let me join their research groups but they would not have been able to provide me with funding right away. Because I got a fully funded offer at Virginia Tech I decided to not go with those offers but you can get a host of responses based on what their needs are. So it's definitely a cheaper alternative than fully employed researchers and especially when it comes to international students, you’re only allowed to get paid for 20 hours but there’s usually no limit on however much you’re working. So they also want to hire good international students for their labs, they are all for diversity and our hardworking, smart attitude. So try to have a positive outlook when you’re writing your application and talking to the administration and the professors. Try to contact the department heads for asking about availability of teaching assistant positions because they’re usually the ones in charge of that. Even if they don’t have positions in their department, they can refer you to other departments. Like most of the departments in sciences they have a lot of engineering students in the science departments. For example, I took an environmental chemistry course in my degree which is primarily a science course. This is why there are more engineers in science courses. Moreover things can change with each college, I think it's a good idea to find like minded people in your college and I’m sure they would definitely try to help you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How would you suggest the upcoming scenario for the fall admit of this year or next year because of the COVID pandemic because a lot of students who got admits this year and getting deferred to next year. So all the potential applicants for the next year, what are the things they should be worried about or what things they can do in the present year to make sure that their application stands out for their next year? What do you think would be the impact in general for Indian students going abroad?</strong></p><p>I definitely think there will be a drastic change because the classes would be held online. So a lot of colleges are already holding their fall semesters online including my own. While some have decided to have a mix of both. So the bigger classes will be held online so if you're having some courses in your degree, they’ll most probably be held online. So with those core courses the number of students is larger because they’re mandatory to take them. I personally would have preferred to have first semester offline because that would have helped me to get acquainted with the normal culture and the expectations of the course. My prediction would be that by 2021, things would be restored to normalcy at least for the most part. I would also like to add that for the most part usually during these recession times, the US government puts a lot of stimulus money within the universities to generate research opportunities. The reason is that it is cheaper to employ research assistants and Phd students than generating employment in the industry and it generates much more jobs in the long run and this happened in the 2008 recession as well. They put in a lot of money to research and it is a really good time to pursue a masters or a thesis start in a Phd. A lot people in the US maybe have been fired usually go back to schools to pursue higher education so a lot Phd students come and there is a lot of grant flow that takes place. But I would definitely say that you should do your own cost benefit analysis and check if you feel your online education is worth it for 1-2 semesters. So take your own call because I would say that the face to face experience is really worth it and you really learn a lot and it's a surreal environment. So I live in a college town, which is essentially a small town of 40,000 people wherein 30,000 are Virginia Tech students. If you have a composition like that in a place, it is very productive because you always find young people around you and they’re always active in doing different things. Losing that is very sad because that experience is very significant for someone to see when they come here. So I would just like to advise you to take your own call. It should get easier from now on and people that would be graduating in 2022, that is the people coming here this fall, would definitely be in a better situation as compared to the ones that just graduated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So any last words or advice for current undergraduate environmental engineers/students of DTU or students in general who wish to pursue masters abroad? What are things that you should focus on while building your application and what things are under your control to shape your inclination within a particular branch such that 5 years later you won't regret the decision of choosing to pursue academia over industry and let go of more lucrative things in life to get more knowledge in academia.</strong></p><p>I would like to say that you will get ample opportunities to shift fields in the longer scheme of things. Usually you should just try to go with your gut instincts and put your hands into as many things that you can because that would help you eliminate options one by one. I think that's one strategy that has worked for me. Environmental engineering is not the hardest thing to score marks in and try to maintain a good academic record in case you want to study further. Try to find good opportunities and those chunks of knowledge and try to have that faith that it will possibly connect and that is where you will get those insights and those creativity flowing in so just have to have a little bit faith in yourself.</p>",

This is not a tribute piece to his career, but rather one to the group of cricketers, and the period of time in Indian cricket, that preoccupied the first chapter of the lives of millions of Indians and inspired them to take just the one extra step toward their ambitions.</i></p><p>For many, the 2002 NatWest Trophy heralded a much-needed reboot of Indian cricket. For my generation, this was where Indian cricket started. Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif - two youngsters with a handful of international matches under their belt – taking India past the finish line against an experienced England team was just the push we needed to go all-in on cricket as our sport of choice.</p><p>For some context, this was still a time when TV sets were switched off and Akashvaani bid farewell half its viewership as soon as Tendulkar lost his wicket. The deference accorded to Tendulkar by the Indian public at large is unfathomable for any player in today’s times. Tendulkar <i>was</i> Team India. For any other player to showcase the capability – nay, have the audacity – to carry a match in which Tendulkar failed, was stuff of astonishment.</p><p>The months after India’s World Cup Final loss in 2003 saw the emergence of the new Indian team – one with a fair balance of declared legends and prospective legends. But more than that, this team gave my generation unprecedented freedom of choice. The sheer abundance of talent in this team allowed us to trust players <i>apart </i>from Tendulkar, at times even depend on them to win us a match. This was unthinkable just a few short years ago.</p><p>Indian cricket rose above its Bombay-Delhi hegemony. We could now admire MS Dhoni from Bihar, Suresh Raina or Mohammad Kaif from Uttar Pradesh and Harbhajan Singh or Yuvraj Singh from Punjab. We could win an away series in England and speculate how it felt to win a World Cup.</p><p>And then, we did.</p><p>Hardly any senior played the 2007 World T20. Most viewers took it as an experimental tournament with an experimental India captain – Dhoni. We couldn’t beat Australia or England outside India without Tendulkar, Dravid or Ganguly, could we? Why was a third of the Indian squad made up of names we’d never heard before? Wait, did we just win a World Cup?</p><p>India paraded its way to victory throughout the world for the next five years. Dhoni didn’t just turn out to be a good captain, but India’s best. Tendulkar found his second prime. Out of a team of eleven, up to nine Indian players were capable of bowling, and a similar number of batting. India won the Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia, drew a Test Series in South Africa and was virtually unassailable at home.</p><p>Our sights, though, were set firmly on the 2011 World Cup. We played a veritable league of legends – all the players our generation had looked up to for the past decade were now together, and raring to win. Rightly, win we did.</p><p>Eras seldom end in one clean stroke. Soon after the World Cup win, India began a gradual baton hand-over. Dravid retired in 2011 and VVS Laxman in 2012. Tendulkar retired, with the grandest retirement ceremony for any sportsperson in living memory, in 2013. Sehwag and Zaheer followed in 2015. By early 2020, Yuvraj, Irfan Pathan and Gautam Gambhir had all announced their choice to hang up their boots.</p><p>The retirement of Dhoni – their longest-serving captain – is also a declaration of the closure of this chapter of Indian cricket. In more ways than one, it is the <i>Thank You </i>slide of the presentation of Indian cricket in the new millennium. It comes at a time when many of our generation are at an inflection point, toying with what to do with the rest of our life. And, it comes with a message – It’s our turn to shine.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>You are a visiting professor at IIT Bombay, an adjunct professor at VIT and an associate professor at ADM. What differences or striking qualities have you observed over the map of India?</strong><br>Over the map of India, in the last ten years, there has been an increase in awareness regarding design and design education. Not just design and design education, but more and more engineering programmes are also understanding that design is not just designing components, design must be all-encompassing and holistic, involving human beings in the process too. This is a huge trend.</p><p>For example, take IIT Bombay and VIT. They have different accents. IIT’s have been traditionally experimentalists. They still try to inculcate experimentation and maybe failure is not tolerated, but deviations from the mainstream are. VIT on the other hand wants to have a structured education program and it may not look like it, but their end goal is to get their students whereas IIT Bombay is sure that its students will find jobs so they’re pushing for innovation and creativity. The ideology of IIT Bombay doesn’t centre around finding jobs for its students. They give their students opportunity to prepare their folio and then the student must stand for himself and seek a job.</p><blockquote><p>So, it’s assumed that ultimately, all students will manage to bag a job, so they urge the students to be fresh and creative.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly. VIT is looking at, four years from now where my design students will go, so even though the teaching pedagogy is like that of IIT, the students’ expectations are different. The students at IIT, they want to pick my brain, with good reason, because they want to achieve what I have achieved in certain spheres. At VIT they want to know how I got my job and how I progressed in my career. It’s embedded in me because only when you ask me to deconstruct them, I start deconstructing, but what was built in me through IIT was so natural, that you be prepared and once you prepare you can attend the job interview and I’m sure you’ll do well. It’s not arrogance but its confidence. That’s the difference. Overall in India, the design industry and education are at their best right now.<br><br><strong>Do you think there will be an increase in awareness about design education, in the future?</strong></p><p>There will be a plateau. Everybody wants to know what their model of design education stands, but in my opinion each area has their own set of ideologies and philosophy and if you’re able to understand the underlying set of ideologies, it will work all over. You must know what has to be embedded and what has to be portrayed. So, this is my experience of last ten years of teaching.</p><p><strong>You are associate chair at Nanyang Technological University. What differences do you see in design education in India and in Singapore?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In both the countries, the students are interested in sustainability. They are a little concerned that their children may not be able to enjoy the world as it is today. The main difference is that you are looking at Singapore, an island city, and only so many designers and media artist can find jobs within, so we are preparing our students for a global experience. You could be in Singapore, but you may be designing for India or China.</p><p>Whereas if you look at India, the population is so huge and there seems to be an internal environment and demand for designers and media artists. So, it brings me to my point, our way of looking at students is different, and we decided that we can’t be a master of single element of design and media. At the same time, we cannot water down our efforts so we give a chance to our students to build an interdisciplinary design education curriculum which they would like to pursue. We show them the different courses that are available and what pathways those courses will take you along and depending on what frame of mind you are in at that point of time, we can predict where you will be in five years of time. The students get to choose. Some of them would say “I want to do product design only” and some of them would graduate as a general designer. So, they can fit into industry where they are looking for generals.</p><p>We must remember that the mindset of the student and their job functions are different in Singapore. More often than not, most of the students don’t want to join a big company, for the reason that such companies don’t exist. They exist as a headquarter but never as manufacturer. So, they see themselves trying to club together to form short-term companies like joint ventures or they would like to have shared offices. They try to find jobs which they can do together and make money. But if they get a product-based design job, that’s fine too. “We are a team”, is a trend which is catching on in Singapore.</p><p><strong>Do you think it will catch on in India too?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The urban society? Yes. But where it is really needed is in the suburbs and rural community where our education as designers gives us certain skills, which may be useful to help solve some of the problems of rural India. For example, sanitation has been the biggest issue, but the PwD can’t solve it. We must come up with a more creative way of dealing with it.</p><p>And if this is going to happen, you will see an increase in the numbers of design entrepreneurs who are committed to a social cause. My concern is, where is the business model. At the end of the day when you settle down or you are with your mom and dad, they will ask you where is the bread and the butter coming from.</p><p>Altruism is not going to give you a business model. You can have a Gandhian perspective, but it’s not right if you say everything is for free. Because you have a wife and a child to look after and a society to look after. So, what kind of design entrepreneurs will come and how would they portray their business, so people won’t perceive them as taking advantage.</p><p>This is a dichotomy which we all face. We want to make a social progress, but we cannot do it if we cannot have our bread and butter. The equation changes when I want to have bread on the table and my son wants to have a cake. So, with that in mind, if I have a business model and I apply it to a social cause, the powers that be might think I am trying to exploit them. So, this is going to be the challenge for Indian design entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are a REP fellow at Nanyang Technological University. Can you tell us about the Renaissance engineering program?</strong></p><p>Renaissance engineering program is a high-level engineering program in Singapore. It is based on the Renaissance movement that happened long ago in Italy, where art, science, engineering and technology came together as one. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci cannot be classified as artists. They were architects, engineers, artists and designers and that eventually led to the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>Renaissance engineering program is a program in which students learn, not just engineering, but they understand other aspects of art, design, economy and it gives them an advantage as to what would working for Renaissance artist be.</p><blockquote><p>So, this is like a shift in narrative from design-centric approach to a broader perspective.</p></blockquote><p>A shift in narrative and a shift in effort. I mean I go and teach what industrial design is. You might grow up to be leaders or heads of corporations, but if you require someone to design a campaign, who to look for and how to use. Similarly, economics is taught in a manner that it is useful for them, not as a subject. So, at the end of the day they have a Capstone project which will combine all of this together</p><p>The Renaissance engineering program gives you a bachelor’s degree plus a master’s in management plus one year of studying in one of the best universities in the world. REP fellows are selected based on the capabilities to teach and lead.</p><p><strong>You co-founded Inovasia Design in Singapore and are a successful design entrepreneur. Keeping in mind the dichotomy that exists in society, how can budding entrepreneurs achieve middle ground and rise?</strong></p><p>It can be achieved very well and effectively, when human beings are the heart and soul of your consulting. You’re not designing for the interest of the marketing; you’re not designing purely for the profit or for that the management that wants this product. You are designing it for the human being. If that is the central aspect of yours, everything else will fall in place.</p><p>Focus on the user. For example, if you want to design medical equipment, there are three people who will predominantly be the users. One is the patient themselves, second is the patient care person, the nurse and all that, who take you around and the third is the doctor. If you design an equipment, the doctor may not want to touch it, for some odd reasons, they will touch it with a pencil. If you design a control panel, they’ll keep punching it and if it breaks down, I failed as a designer because I didn’t foresee this.</p><p>Secondly, the nurse will touch it. They will clean their hands and clean their equipment. Thirdly, if I am designing a medical product, I need to care for the patient, and I want to see his comfort. Moreover, he should not be intimidated by the display. What the doctor needs to know, the patient doesn’t. In movies, many a times the doctor would walk in and say, “Oh! The heart rate is 56, it’s going down.” That’s the last thing the patient wants to hear. There should be a cautionary message that’s sent to the nurse and to the doctor, so that they can come and correct it. So, the designing a medical equipment is multi-faceted. You come to the aesthetic of it. It should exuberate confidence. You don’t skip into a ward wearing a skirt. <i>(Laughs)</i></p><p>You must be prepared for it. Similarly, a product with a thousand wires around it won’t give you confidence. We need to have foresight, while developing. The nurse too must know which coloured wire to press and which to put. Designers have traditionally had this mindset, color-coding things so that they are easier to use.</p><p><i>Sounds incredibly tough.</i></p><p>It is. It is complex rather than complicated.</p><p><strong>You interned as a student at the Sony Design Centre in Tokyo. How was your experience and how did it help you evolve as a product designer?</strong></p><p>See, IIT taught me to be a designer of the Ulm School, where everything was very organized and there is some structure to it but embedded with Indian ethos and culture. As a designer, personally, I was confident in conceptualizing and sketching and all that. At Sony, I realised that a designer has to have discipline. You are not an artist; you are a designer. Someone asks you to design a Sony Walkman, you have to know that there are two targets in mind. One, it has to be a saleable product, as defined by the marketing or as per your definition. Second is that, this product has to reliable, in terms of its mechanics, which is the art of an engineer but those two things have to be come together in a usable structure that allows the user to know that this is the right thing I have and this is going to work correctly. Sony built its reputation on this very foundation. You are not playing games with yourself but artistically you are playing a game, you are enjoying this moment. So, discipline is if I told you I’m going to submit it today, I will, because each for each delay, there are repercussions.</p><p>I also realised that the product is bigger than yourself, even if you’re designing a little hearing aid, the product is bigger than yourself. You cannot go out and show off that you designed a hearing aid, nobody wants to really know. When they use the hearing aid, and they feel it has served its purpose, the look on their face, and the happiness that time when someone says you know what Peer &amp; Partners must have designed this, that’s the goal. So, let the work speak for itself. You can always leave your signature, to say that I designed this, and people will find out. We never marketed Inovasia Design when we were in Asia, it was always word of mouth. The confidence our clients had in us was also very motivating. It is the calmness that my Indian education has brought to me and my professors who taught me. If you have not understood your own design, it’s not going to work.</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for students of the design program?</strong></p><p>Make the most of these four years to explore and gain. You must have your own opinion as to what works, what doesn’t, what is the human factor, what is the aesthetics, what is the emotional conviction that the product must have. The product is bigger than you and in order to do that, we cannot rush to the destination, even though we have a deadline. If you rush into a product, you will make mistakes. My message is, do not try to impress people, express yourself.</p>",

A song, some poetry, a clutter of words that seemed to somehow form nothing much but distortion. Every part of it, she approves, is what collocates with the devilish funny people, a discotheque with anecdoche and glitched jouska all around, the madness of everything.

    "body": "<p><strong>What was your preparation strategy for GMAT and how would you advise a candidate to approach the test?</strong></p><p>There are two strategies which a student can follow. The first one is to do all the preparation by yourself and the other is to take help. In my case, I was working and my job was very hectic, so I decided to take up a course to get some clarity about where to study from and what to study. I took an&nbsp; online course where they didn’t have tutors but videos, graded quizzes, mocks and analysis. Since it was an online course, I was able to complete it while I was at home. It turned out&nbsp; to be so good that even after the exam I didn’t feel like there was anything that was out of syllabus.</p><p><strong>Would you advise other candidates to go for an online course? Is it enough?</strong></p><p>Yes, if you are in a position like mine<i> </i>and have a job and there is a lot that you have to balance then definitely go for a course because otherwise, you’ll just end up looking for materials from different places and that’ll take up a lot of your time. But, in case you have the time and the willingness to do it,&nbsp; you can prepare without the course as well.</p><p><strong>What prompted you to pursue a Master’s in Management? What was your motivation?</strong></p><p>There were several types of courses available to me. After working for a year in consulting, I was sure about what I wanted to do, and that was to not&nbsp; continue in consulting. I felt this was a good way to switch my career and if you have the certainty then why wait? I was sure that I wanted to do my master's from abroad but MBA didn’t seem like a great choice because I would have had to continue working for three to four years before going and I was already certain about what I wanted to do my master's in.&nbsp; Masters in Management is a very upcoming course. It's on the positive side of the incline and it is getting a lot of people to move into Europe and the US so I felt that its popularity is only set to increase.</p><p><strong>How would you compare MiM with MBA? Is having work experience a requisite?</strong></p><p>For MiM it is not necessary to have work experience. Inside the MiM program that I’m in, students are encouraged to take one gap year in between the two years of education and to work in 2-3 different internships during that time. This has the advantage of making you aware of what your future career might look like at the end of your education. Even so, people generally do come here with about one to two years of experience, but not more than that. For an MBA, on the other hand, two to three years of work experience is mandatory. This is evidenced by the fact that most people who get admitted to prestigious MBA programs abroad have more than four or five years of experience. This is the first basis of comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>The second one is the age group. The people in my batch have an average age of about twenty-three years whereas in the case of an MBA, the average age is about twenty-seven and the students are a bit more mature. I feel that if someone is in a profession they want to pursue, but are not sure about what they want to do their master’s in, they should continue working and then, once they are certain, they should go for an MBA. But, in case you're in a career that you want to switch, or you are certain that this is what you want to get in, then I think it's better to just go for a master’s early on, because then, even though you're still twenty-five or twenty-six, you already have all that clarity plus the education.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, it just boils down to the personal choices of the student and how they want to go about their career path. Some people prefer to experiment by doing an MiM and various internships while they are young in order to have some assurance before entering that career. But there are others who have great satisfaction with what they're doing, and wish to work for a few years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If a student wishes to pursue a course in management after their undergraduate engineering degree, would MiM be a good choice ?</strong></p><p>My opinion is that because we've studied four years of engineering, most students are not very informed about what goes on in the non-tech sector. Most often, we enter into the field of consulting blindly without realizing what it actually entails. I personally know of friends who have switched their careers entirely after their engineering education and it has worked for them. But, in my opinion, if one really wants to pursue non-tech or management, it is a good idea to have a year of work experience and DTU definitely gives you the opportunity to work in great companies after your engineering degree. This will have the advantage of giving you some much-needed experience and clarity of thought which will be beneficial during your master’s degree.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think was your biggest apprehension before starting off with your preparation journey?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was really particular about the schools to get into and because MiM is a very up-and-coming course, there are not many schools which provide it; the best business schools have just started taking up the course. For example, INSEAD just started the MiM course last year. It was important that I get into the best school because unlike an MBA, where you can do well even if you get into the top 15 or even top 20 colleges in the US, the quality of the MiM course heavily depends on where you do it from. I was very apprehensive about not getting into one of my dream colleges and about my future plans if such a thing actually came to pass.</p><p>Another factor to be considered was the duration of the course. For example, LBS offered only a year-long and INSEAD just 10 months!&nbsp; I felt that the time was a bit too short for me and wouldn’t work out in the end. In a nutshell, the entire process of college selection was extremely tedious!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Was HEC, Paris consciously your target from the very beginning?</strong></p><p>Not really. Because I had done my graduation in engineering and never studied these subjects before, I wasn’t sure about whether I wanted to get into marketing, finance or company law, and they're all quite different fields. I didn’t like the idea of pursuing a one-year long course where you just get in and by the time you're figuring things out, you also have to start looking for internships and jobs. That extremely fast pace was something I didn't want. I was very fixated on doing MiM, which was a two-year long course which is why I rolled out of INSEAD and LBS and all the other schools as well. Another thing I like about the two-year courses is that they give you ample time to do your internships in Europe or the US or the rest of the world. This was a plus point for me because I had never worked outside of India and felt that it was important to get an idea about the work culture usually followed in other countries before I started working there. In the end, out of all the colleges that I liked, <i>ESSEC </i>and<i> HEC</i> were the only universities that were providing the two-year long course and I ended up applying to only these two B-Schools.</p><p>The location was not a conscious choice for me and I chose HEC because I really liked the course and the college. There was also one last, very conscious decision - I have done my engineering in the fields of&nbsp; civil and environmental engineering; civil mainly, but I took up a lot of environmental subjects and that's what my major thesis was also about. I am inclined towards sustainability and incorporating that in management. HEC specifically lays a lot of focus on sustainability management, sustainability consulting, and trying to incorporate sustainability in whatever we are studying. They have a sustainability organization as well as many clubs which are actively working towards sustainability in general with brands or inside the campus. I really liked the fact that they've put so much focus on something that I have studied a little bit about during my graduation and which I would love to incorporate with my management degree. This is one of the reasons that made me choose HEC, not the rankings or the location.</p><p><strong>Talk us through the different aspects of the application process. Was there a part in the application that you thought was unique?</strong></p><p>I spent more than eight months on my application starting from the day I began preparing for my GMAT to the day I actually gave it. TOEFL was not required because I’d completed my engineering education in the English medium.&nbsp;</p><p>Essays are another very important part of the application process after the GMAT. The essays took me a lot of time because I was expected to condense my life and make sense out of everything that had happened till now. Trying to view a story out of whatever had happened in my life and how to relate it to my desire to attend HEC was an extremely tedious task. Even after I did write the essay, I didn’t know whether it was good or not because there’s no particular way to go about this process.</p><p>The forms I had to fill during the application process were also really long and I was asked to submit recommendations. As I had already started working for a year, I had to go back to college to all the professors I knew and ask them if they remembered me!</p><p>The toughest part of the process starts after the forms have been submitted because HEC usually filters out 70% of the candidates at this stage solely on the basis of GMAT scores, essays and recommendations.</p><p>This round is followed by the interviews which are no less of an ordeal. In this round, the interviewers want to find out whether you're actually the person who you claim to be in your applications and if you really stand for whatever you've said. The interviewers are experts in their field and&nbsp; dive deep into every aspect of your form.&nbsp;</p><p>What I really liked about the HEC interview process was that they don't have a set pattern that you have to meet and the interviewers will dive very deep into your past experiences. During my interview, I was talking about sustainability and I was asked questions like “<i>Where do you think in finance is sustainability playing a role and how do you think your engineering will actually come to use in our classes that will happen on campus?</i>” In conclusion, they expect you to be clear about <i>what you want, how you want to get it and why you want to be there</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What, according to you, made your application stand out? Did you pursue any activities at college which you feel have helped you with your application?</strong></p><p>Definitely! I had an active college life. During my first year I had no clue about societies but later I joined the dramatics society<i>,</i> where we did a lot of plays on social issues; we used to do a<i> Nukkad</i> in which we would spend one year researching about one particular social issue and then we’d go and perform about it on the streets. Then, I started an initiative called <i>‘Let's Talk’</i> with my best friend from college and that society is still going on! The main aim of ‘Let’s Talk’ was to form a bridge between students who wished to mentor younger students especially in terms of their spoken English, because a lot of college students don't feel so confident about the language and feel that it sets them back. I also did internships every summer and winter break, starting from my second year. For example, one of my internships was in the field of journalism, with Times Internet, which is the digital arm of the Times of India and another at IIT Kharagpur which was all about sanitation and environment.</p><p>With all these things in my CV, I had the content prepared by the time the application process started; I just had to connect all the dots and see what came out of my internships. I think my college, and the course that I was doing - civil and environmental - somehow helped me a lot because the biggest pitch in my HEC application was that I wanted to work in sustainability and management. And the sustainability domain only comes from my prior engineering education. A lot of people say that after engineering one must first work for three years in management in order to get into a good B-School. But I don't think that’s true anymore. In fact, <i>engineering complements the management degree and that's how I think DTU worked out for me.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>What is a common mistake that you think could be a possible pitfall for candidates applying for the MiM program?</strong></p><p>A common bias we have is that exam scores are the most important part of the application, but I know of people who had great GMAT scores but lagged in other parts of the application and ended up not being accepted.</p><p>I feel like the universities, especially the ones abroad, lay equal focus on all domains of your application. So don’t leave out or take for granted any part of the application, even if you think it’s a part where you’ll shine the most.</p><p>Secondly, as I have mentioned earlier, college and course selection are also extremely important. Ranking alone doesn’t determine the value of the college or the course you end up pursuing there. You’ll have to make sure that you like your course as well and have to make sure that it aligns with your career expectations. The course duration, location, culture and other personal reasons should also factor into your decision-making and it’s fine to rule out a college or course on that basis.</p><p><strong>Is there any specific advice you have for a candidate who may apply for this program but hasn’t started out for it yet? How should someone go about deciding on it?</strong></p><p>A practical advice would be to use LinkedIn. If you found someone currently working in the field that you are interested in, reaching out to them is a great way to know more about their journey. Not everyone will be willing to talk to you, but you’ll find some who will be more than willing to help you out.</p><p>In my case as well, I reached out to people from top universities and spoke to them about what the course was like. Making a good LinkedIn profile is important as people will try to get to know you better before connecting to you.</p><p>Also, it’s important to have certainty about what you are preparing for and why, as the process is six months long and losing sight of the goal could make the entire process feel more like a drag. That’s why even if it takes more time to be certain about your decision, it is wise to spend that extra time.</p><p><strong>Is there a particular timeline that one should follow in college to get ready for the admissions abroad?</strong></p><p>There’s no set timeline, and everyone can go about it differently at their own pace. Having some clarity as early as possible helps but isn’t vital to the process. But still, starting to think about your career path from the second year is beneficial.</p><p><strong>Essays, as you mentioned, are crucially important in the process, so what do you think makes for a good essay and does the criteria for a good essay differ according to the university that you’re applying to?</strong></p><p>Yes, essays do form a significant component of the application. There are a lot of online resources that tell you different ways in which you can come up with a good essay, but I feel like writing an essay yourself makes the writing personal and authentic. From my experience, a good, personalized story and a good understanding of cause and consequence of whatever we have done so far and why we want to pursue a particular path, makes for a well-rounded essay. Before starting to write, brainstorm around everything that has happened in your life and how it has led to one thing or the other. Now, how the different colleges look at your essays varies only to a little extent. How well you put your story across is all that matters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has your experience been at HEC so far?</strong></p><p>It has been lovely, especially because I have done everything online for the past one and a half year and getting to experience this offline is a really great change of pace. One thing about HEC that I really like is that they have tried to bring in one of the most diverse groups of individuals from across the world. For example, in the past two weeks that I have been here, I have gotten the chance to interact with people from Brazil, Cameroon, the USA, etc. Also, there have been some really fun experiences as well, like making two Italian people taste Pav Bhaji for the first time! DTU also has a diverse group of people in it to begin with, and I was glad I could continue to enjoy that experience on a much larger scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "slug": "mitacs-gri-internship-experience-837",
    "body": "<p><strong>THE PREPARATION</strong></p><p>I got to know about MITACS towards the end of my first year and right from then I had it in my mind that I have to apply here. I talked to seniors from our college who previously had been selected for the same and gathered information about everything - from profile building to the process involved and the interviews. I realised that to have a good chance of getting selected it's important to have some sort of research experience in the resume. The CGPA factor was definitely there in my head because I had heard that only people having CGPA more than 9 have a chance of getting selected and at the time of my application, my CGPA was only 8.1. But I would say it's just a myth and your overall profile is the key and not just your CGPA. From the beginning of my second year, I started gaining experience in different domains, acquired some technical skills and did some research work to build my profile.</p><p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR MITACS GRI:</strong></p><p>The first step in the procedure is to apply for the MITACS Globalink Research Internship on the MITACS website. The application includes several fields to be filled up by the applicant.</p><ol><li>Register on the <strong>MITACS portal</strong> – <a href=\"https://globalink.mitacs.ca/gri/index.html\">https://globalink.MITACS.ca/gri/index.html</a></li><li>The <strong>‘Personal Information’</strong> section implores basic details. I understand everyone has a nicely structured CV/Resume of their own, however, MITACS wants it to be tailored according to their needs. So, strictly follow their guidelines for uploading the CV/Resume.</li><li>Under the <strong>‘Education’</strong> section, you will have to upload your transcript (ignore the fact that they’ve asked it 4 times, just upload it once). The English proficiency exam is not compulsory and will not increase or decrease your chances of getting the scholarship.</li><li>The <strong>‘Research’</strong> section is the most important and scrutinized one of all. It has four sub-sections. Take your time to fill out each of them. MITACS has a word limit, so you must learn to omit superfluous words and be succinct.&nbsp;</li><li>For <strong>‘General Description of Skills, Background Knowledge, and Research Interests’</strong>, I wrote bullet points under each of the topics separately. Skills here refer to your software (and maybe soft skills) and technical skills. Jot down your coursework in the Background Knowledge and anything else if necessary.</li></ol><p><strong>‘Notable Achievements’ </strong>is pretty self-explanatory. Please include only those achievements that you think are noteworthy. Don’t use the terms which they might not understand - such as ‘Festember’, ‘Pragyan’ (give a brief description if you’re mentioning them).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘Research Rationale’ </strong>was the hardest for me to write despite it having a requirement of 100 words. When it comes to SOPs, the shorter the word limit, the harder it gets. Think about why you really want to pursue research, if you feel there is a personal and emotional connection to it then do mention it. If you’ve had any life-changing events or lectures, mention them. Write it once, come back after a day and read it afresh. Edit it and do the same at least 4–5 times. I would definitely not say that this decides whether you get through, but it is important.</p><blockquote><p>The toughest part, I would say, is choosing the projects. And since there are so many (and we have amazing net speed here!), use as many filters as you can and narrow down the areas to suit your needs. I faced the problem where I had to make a trade-off between a good project and a good university. I went ahead with the good university, but I feel like that was a slight error on my part. If you have the same conundrum, go with a good project if you really like it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Please don’t wait till the last day to do something! Finish your application 10 days in advance and keep proof-reading it every two days. Also, if you did not know already, DO NOT mail any of the professors separately. MITACS highly discourages that practice (which only saves you more time). Once you’re done with the application, you might or might not get interview calls from professors. I got two interviews but many of my acquaintances didn’t get any interviews. So, if you don’t, there is no need to worry. Some professors just like to talk and interact once before they take a student in and some feel that your application is enough whereas some might be just too busy.</p></blockquote><p><strong>AFTER APPLYING:</strong></p><p>After the submission of the application, there are three categories:</p><ol><li><strong>No longer under consideration:</strong> Under this category, you are either not eligible for the internship or there are some discrepancies in your application.</li><li><strong>Waitlist:</strong> Under this category, you will have to wait for the next round for consideration.</li><li><strong>Candidate under consideration:</strong> Under this, you will either have to sit for interviews or will be given tasks related to the project. If selected, you will be given a choice of reordering your projects. In the end, you will receive an offer letter having the details of your internship.</li></ol><p>At first, I was waitlisted. My confirmation came in March. So, you just need to be patient and waitlisted doesn't always mean that you are rejected.</p><p><strong>MY EXPERIENCE</strong><br><br>I started my internship on May 3, 2021. I was selected by <strong>Dr. Seonghwan Kim</strong> of <strong>University of Calgary</strong> and the title of my project was <strong>‘Novel Nano-metrologies for Advanced Visualization and Characterization of Soft Materials’</strong>. My role here was to do data analysis and visualisation of AFM data/images.</p><p>Nowadays, AFM or Atomic Force microscopy technique has become quite popular. The main reason behind this is that it enables imaging of almost any kind of surface like polymers, ceramics, composites, glass, or any other soft surface. This fact gives it an edge over techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (which requires the specimen to be a conductor).</p><p>I had to first do a <strong>literature survey</strong> for which I <strong>read more than 100 papers</strong>, prepared a literature review, and submitted it to the professor. All these resources were made available to me by the professor and his postdoctoral fellow.</p><p>I later got training on how to use Open Access Software like <strong>Gwyddion</strong> and <strong>Anasys</strong> which were later used by me for the analysis of real time images.</p><p>I also studied the ‘<strong>Autocorrelation Function</strong>’ here and used it to find out the trends and patterns which were published later in the paper. Weekly meetings were held with my professor and a postdoctoral fellow was there every time to help me out in case of any doubts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of my internship my professor also offered me to join him after my graduation and carry on the research meanwhile.</p><blockquote><p>One key point which I want to mention is that till the time the internship started, I had switched my profile to non-tech and luckily due to the pandemic, the internship was done virtually and hence my work was more in the analytics domain. This helped me in during the placement session. But students should be careful while applying because it might ruin their profile in case of a profile switch later.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The whole internship was a dream come true; I could see my work being valued by such distinguished people. All in all, it was quite an enriching experience which gave me a lot of exposure.</strong></p><p><strong>My Advice:</strong></p><ol><li>Your main resource is the internet, coupled with your persistence to succeed.</li><li>Communication is important. You should know how to interact with strangers and keep up a good conversation.</li><li>It happens quite often that students don’t know about the scholarships, and that automatically dents their chances of getting it.&nbsp; Ask your professors and seniors continuously about scholarships and events and keep a constant vigil in your field of interest for other opportunities.</li><li>Building a rich research profile in your specific interest is also advantageous. DTU has a plethora of opportunities for a young researcher in the form of tech teams, and students should make the best use of these.</li><li>I don’t want to be a buzzkill here, but yes, GPA matters but not entirely.</li><li>The first step is to identify your area of interest. As a fresher, you are often quite confused and that is natural. Don’t take undue pressure, just work towards your interest from the beginning. Usually, a slothful attitude won’t get you far in the race.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>The olfactory sense is the strongest sense for eliciting nostalgic memories. A scent or smell has the most profound ability to stir even the deepest corners of our memories. I remember a friend who told me that, as I felt a strangely familiar, warm smell on an unusually inimical winter evening. I know this smell from a similar evening, a similar walk back in the first year but with a very different me. The vague feeling of some known comfort somehow connected these different dots over the long stream of time.</p><p>Human beings perceive time on a logarithmic scale. That is to say, time picks up the pace as we steer our way through life. Childhood seems like something that lasted forever, not very long ago. Perhaps that is why we have the fondest memories from that time. We go back to these memories every time we encounter a relic from that guileless age—the toys we became too old to play with, the anecdotes that our mothers recount so adoringly on quiet afternoons. When we see kids living what we once lived through, it’s all a slice of that same vaguely familiar comfort. As we see the world around us unfolding, we seek more of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the playground where we spent countless days with friends, we return there only to see the structures that towered over us are now barely taller than us. The monkey bars we used to struggle on now need us to crouch down to hold them properly. The swing where we pointlessly swung on now barely fits us. The slide that used to be the joy of our days is not even a second long, just like the ‘older kids’ of that time long gone, whom we remember doing the same thing as us today. It is a memory that we leave behind in the past, just like the playground we have outgrown.</p><p>Just by growing older, the very way we see the world changes. This realization hits especially hard when we return to an old house we lived in as a child after many years. The house feels surprisingly small. The ceiling, which used to be as far as the skies, is now just a stool length away. The floor, which took many strides to traverse, can now be scaled in just a few steps.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like how scents and smells disappear after a while, our childhoods also fade away as we grow older. Yet the feelings and emotions we felt from them remain, much like how we return to the scents that we love, the memories of our past form a shelter where we can always come back to for a short while. Perhaps College is where this search is the most conspicuous. We rediscover pieces that were lost in the relentless pursuit of exams and seats. We paint the canvas of the new world around us with colors of what we have known in sheer childlike excitement. The slow moments of languor ironically remind us how fast time is making those things around us a part of that same nostalgic train.&nbsp;</p><p>And it is to those moments I credit the realization that life is us filling in the blanks of new experiences. We become who we are through what we have lived. To come back to that solace is natural, and that is what nostalgia does. It sums up who we have been, like the known cracks and crevices of your own home. It gives perspective on what we could be. It’s an ease that relieves the turmoil of the new, and maybe make long walks like these a lot shorter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Why did you feel inclined towards preparing for the CAT out of all the different options available to you?</strong></p><p>The decision to pursue an MBA was the key behind opting for CAT. Once I was sure about the first part, the list of potential exams boiled down to CAT and GMAT. MBA from abroad usually requires work experience and the situation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic also acted as a deterrent, Therefore, I decided to prepare for CAT and complete my studies in India itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Briefly take us through your preparation journey. What is it that you feel you did differently from others?</strong></p><p>I started my preparation around the beginning of 2021 and joined Alchemist, a coaching institute. To begin with, I attempted a couple of actual CAT papers (2019 Slot 1 and 2020 Slot 3) to gauge my ability without any formal preparation. I focused on improving the flaws I discovered through this until May. After that, I gave mock tests from Alchemist and IMS till November. In terms of what was unique in my journey, I tailored the course according to my strengths and weaknesses instead of studying everything equally. The other thing that I did well, in my opinion, was that I took as many mock tests as I was comfortable with, contrary to the popular advice of a set number that an aspirant has to attempt per week on the basis of the proximity to the real exam.</p><p><strong>How would you advise a candidate to approach the test?</strong></p><p>My advice would be to attempt a few actual CAT papers in the beginning. If you are able to score over 50%, then just mock tests from any reputed coaching institute would suffice. If not, jot down the mistakes and look for recurring patterns. Start your preparation from the topics you are weak at and move towards your strengths. There is no best way that exists to attempt a section or the whole paper, so you will have to figure out the intricacies before building your own way of taking the exam through mock tests and their analyses.</p><p><strong>What are your future plans after achieving such a phenomenal score?</strong></p><p>In terms of my immediate future, I want to study at one of the top 3 IIMs or XLRI. Beyond that, management consulting intrigues me but I am still open to other options based on my interaction with the students, teachers and the subjects that will be taught in the above-mentioned colleges.</p><p><strong>What advice would you like to give to your juniors who wish to pursue the same career path as yours?</strong></p><p>Be determined about your decision to prepare for CAT or any other other entrance exams, as it will take up a lot of effort and pursuing MBA from one of India’s (or any other nation’s) top B-Schools is a significant financial investment. There will be a lot of uncertainty in your preparation phase regarding the mock test scores but take it as practice before a battle. The more you bleed here, the better you will be when you face the real test.&nbsp;</p><p>College placements will be a crucial period since a lot of your friends will be getting selected at top companies; treat it as motivation for your journey instead of letting it affect your focus. Apart from all this, the one thing you need to trust the most is your ability to make decisions and execute them. There will be a lot of noise around; block most of it, listen to some good advice and trust yourself.</p>",

    "biliner": "DTU Times caught up with the Literature & Film Council of DTU and quizzed them on what goes into organising North India's biggest literature fest, Yuvaan, the crown jewel of the university's ensemble of fests.",
    "slug": "interview-literature-film-council-dtu-839",
    "body": "<p><strong>Yuvaan has always provided its audience with all sorts of engrossing events. And even with the shift of education to synchronised online learning, the events continued with a similar engagement. How did this shift affect the process of organisation and coordination for the team? What are the lesser known or unchartered differences that exist between offline and online events?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ney-vatsa-596253177\"><strong>Ney Vatsa</strong></a><strong> (</strong><i><strong>Fest Secretary</strong></i><strong>):</strong> During lockdown, when we were in second year of college, we were still holding the position of heads in Yuvaan and our council was yet to be released. We had just organised a beautiful fest of&nbsp; Yuvaan 2020 and didn’t want things to go dormant. As we shifted to the online mode, we didn’t want the medium of entertainment to be a restraint. So, we began by researching how other online events were being organised. An online event wasn’t something that was happening for the first time. Many organisations had already been conducting their events online. So, we just had to bring this approach into our practice. This shift from offline to online learning was certainly huge. It is definitely easier to work and manage things offline than online. Nevertheless, being the fest secretary during this period, I learnt certain lessons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The first and the foremost lesson was that it is very important to motivate your own team members to come forward and participate.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is the first thing that one needs to tackle when they are a member of the council. Also, the major responsibility of our council was that we had to undertake responsibilities when the radical change from offline to online had just begun and being at the pitch of this transitional phase, it was also a major challenge to work with the first years as they only had had few months of offline college experience with not much knowledge of organising events. Merely participating in two fests doesn’t really give one the vision and the clarity of how exactly things take place behind the curtains. With all these factors clubbed together, we had to tackle these one by one.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meetali-choudhary-32035b191\"><strong>Meetali Choudhary</strong></a><strong> (</strong><i><strong>Fest Secretary</strong></i><strong>): </strong>It is true that we were the council that undertook responsibilities when we shifted from offline to online and then back to the offline ecosystem. During that time, it was for the first time that all these fests were supposed to be conducted online at a college level and we required engagement there as well. When it’s a cultural fest, people are usually excited in their own way. However, when we talk about a literature fest, it is required that we acquaint the audience with it. In an offline fest, we would have events like book launches, we would have authors visiting us as a part of certain events. For the film fest, we would have short films streamed at the BR Auditorium.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>So, all this wasn’t a possibility if we were organising the fest completely online. We would have to approach the audience through a meet link instead of inviting them to spots like the OAT or the BR Auditorium, for them to enjoy literature and film.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Along with that, the major problem that occurred was that we had to reach people through calls and messages. Additionally, it becomes difficult to motivate a team solely through online meets. Although adding to it, once the team was motivated, as everything was going online - from artists joining to making sure that technically everything was being managed well - we saw people grow and also learnt of better ways to motivate&nbsp; people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’ve always had the chance of witnessing a diverse ensemble of renowned guests through Yuvaan. How difficult does it get when it comes to approaching the guests for the events and how different is it for online and offline events?</strong></p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>The way we approach guests is almost similar in both ways - offline and online. However, when things go offline, the availability of guests does reduce. But there was a phase in between our online period, when the spread of COVID was at its peak, asking people to be a part of Yuvaan’s events was a challenge as everyone was having their own issues due to the spread of COVID. But again, the way of approaching was much similar to what it used to be otherwise. Finding out and fixing slots for online events was much easier as when it’s offline, guests usually have different commitments already taking place.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebani-gupta-she-her-60b701172\"><strong>Ebani Gupta</strong></a><strong> </strong><i><strong>(Treasurer)</strong></i><strong>: </strong>It certainly is largely the same when it comes to only approaching the artists and the guests. We used to reach out to them through Instagram, mails or through their managers or by approaching different event management companies. And all this was largely done via telephonic conversations or emails or messages. But, the large difference that came about was in their availability and also the kind of quotations that they brought about as we didn’t have to carry the expense of their travel or stay. We were aware of the expenses and the funds that we would be requiring, but considering the experience that Yuvaan always tries to provide and to keep up with the name we have tried to maintain, we had to take measures about a whole different scenario. And as we did not have much guidance to go about the working of online events, we had to find out ways on our own and altogether it was an enriching experience.</p><p><strong>There are some challenges that come with being a part of a literary council especially in a college that is highly technical in nature with not a lot of people having an inclination towards literature which is an unlikely scenario in a university like DU. How do you manage to engage so many DTU students even with such little literary appreciation?</strong></p><p><strong>Ney: </strong>When we were preparing for JEE and looking for colleges later, most of us looked into how DTU’s fests were and probably ended up being mesmerised by the YouTube videos of Engifest.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With these videos of Engifest already being a thing ingrained in our minds, we entered DTU with high expectations.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So, it is a pressure to match that level and make sure that these expectations are satisfactorily met. In 2020, when Yuvaan conducted its fourth edition, it turned out to be a big hit. So, we had to match that level too and also take forward the legacy left behind by our seniors. Hence, maintaining motivation is certainly the key. This may have gained more traction in a DU college but we definitely don’t have less appreciation here as well. Yuvaan has a significant recognition for itself now and everyone is a part of it in one way or the other - be it directly or indirectly. It’s not just about being a literature enthusiast but it is also about enjoying the events in a way that you feel a sense of pride for being a part of its organisation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meetali:</strong> Also, regarding the appreciation of literature in our college, we have Sahitya as a society and the members do have this sense of praise and acclamation towards literature. The percentage of people with this sense of recognition might differ when we compare our university with that of any DU college, but it isn’t completely absent. One of the major challenges that we usually have pertaining to this view is that we have to make sure we meet the expectations of the people who actually look up to literature fests. Even though the percentage of such literature enthusiasts is less, we need to ensure that we match up to their excitement and fulfil the expectations that they have. Along with this, luckily as we are not just restricted to our college, seeing people from other colleges participate with such enthusiasm motivates the students of DTU as well.</p><p><strong>Ebani: </strong>The whole fact that technical fields and literature fields are viewed with such contrasts has a beauty in itself. How we can bring about diversity in our college with literature and how well it is appreciated is admirable. A certain DU college may have better recognition but seeing the response here in DTU also we get to know how diversified the personalities here are.&nbsp;</p><p>As a part of the Yuvaan team, how have your perceptions and opinions on literature as a form of art been influenced?</p><p><strong>Ney: </strong>I have been fond of literature since my childhood, I even used to write at times. That is the reason why I joined Yuvaan after being intrigued by it in my first year when Rajat Sood had performed in <i>Pehli Mulaqat</i> and some poets had performed as a part of it during our orientation.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Entering such a challenging level where students were organising such huge events and inviting such renowned artists became one of the factors that motivated me to join the Yuvaan team.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And I got to learn a lot about literature as a member of this team. I got to know about the various forms of literature. Also, I used to think I could write but now that view has completely changed. I am now following the Jaipur Literature &amp; Film Festival and what all things are happening there. I am also following the Bangalore Literature and Film Festival and everything having relevance to it. There are a lot of personal changes that I have experienced as a part of this literature and film council. So, it is not just about the changes that you see overall but it is also about the personal changes.</p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>In my first year, I was not one of the literature enthusiasts. But, once I became a part of&nbsp; Yuvaan - working as a volunteer, then as a head - I got to see a lot of artists performing and got to experience a lot of <i>Kavi Sammelans. </i>With this, there was a different inclination that I imbibed in myself &amp; I realised how nice it all was.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I then started exploring various poets and artists and later in my second year I began writing myself.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I had never thought that this change would have taken place in me by just being a part of a fest. So, it is true that Yuvaan has had a different impact on me on a personal basis. The more you explore the more you begin to appreciate. There is change that then takes place. While you are exploring artists you also begin to start appreciating their work.</p><p><strong>Ebani: </strong>We realise the importance of literature in every field. I remember, when we were once deciding the theme for the fest, we realised that every theme had its inception from literature itself. We ended up discussing exceptional ideas emerging from literature unlike the conventional ones which people usually associate with literature. Literature is much more and much beyond what we usually think of and this can be shared and presented to the whole world. It isn’t something that is merely kept restricted to oneself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was your motivation to join the council and what kept you motivated to stay there? Now that you are graduating, what is your key takeaway from being a part of it?</strong></p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>While we were working as heads in our second year, we realised ‌Yuvaan had reached a notable platform. It had grown from being a small fest to now being a big platform. While we were preparing for Yuvaan 2020, and putting in the hard work, calling for artists, and planning the events; we felt that this time we should do something big. Our motive was to show that literature has its own impact. When the day of the fest came and when we had our events, and we saw so many people appreciating the literature event, that motivated us like crazy. I remember the last day of Yuvaan, all of us were standing, and we knew that we had pulled it off. We had never thought that we could have a literature festival at this level, with people who appreciate literature to this extent. That was the time we realised that we have 2 years of college left, so we have to make sure we do something big. And we wanted to experience the same happiness and satisfaction each year.</p><p>As heads, we saw how our council members were working - going to meetings, going to the admin, and discussing events. We were in the background and engaging in ideas, but we saw the pressure the council had to go through and the amount of hard work they were doing. We were so motivated by them. Unfortunately, afterwards, things got online, so we couldn’t conduct an offline fest. Then there was another challenge with an online fest, to pull something new. Yuvaan had never been online before. When ‘<i>Pehli Mulaqat</i>’&nbsp; took place for the first time, there were so many people in our college who were very excited and I had received so many requests stating that they also wanted to be a part of Yuvaan when the itinerary was released.</p><blockquote><p>Our main takeaway would be that even if something is not huge but you believe it has the potential, and you pull it off, that can give you a lot of teachings along the journey and a lot of pride too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>From just managing a team to having an artist onboard, every experience is a lesson in itself. Every person who approaches an artist for the first time, surely commits a mistake. These mistakes help you learn a lot. From managing the events with the team, managing what your team and faculty advisors want, you grow in so many ways. So if there's something that you think is difficult to pull off and if you take it as a challenge, it will be a different level of happiness when you actually do.</p><p><strong>Ney: </strong>For me it all started with the 3-day event in 2020, when on the last day the sense of relief and pride I derived by looking at the crowd and the rush of emotions on realising we had done this and pulled this off. We knew it was just the beginning. We knew we needed to continue with this in order to go big. We didn't want to be compared with any other event happening in DTU, but we wanted Yuvaan to be recognised as something big, not only within DTU, but across Delhi and the country. We wanted it to be a celebrated fest that people would come to visit from Bombay or maybe some other college from the East. Even though things happened online, I'm satisfied that we, as a team, pulled this off. Even with the transition to online mode, and regardless of all other commitments and emergencies, we successfully organised this event.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We tried to bring artists of different genres; and organised many events. The feeling and the sense of ownership that we got was our major motivation.</p></blockquote><p>I have a lot of takeaways. I made a lot of friends, whom I can call and ask for anything at any time. Apart from that, I gained a perspective on how a team should be managed, the legalities you work with when you approach the clients, and the meetings you attend to. A lot of things were happening at the same time, so we had to stay grounded. We also had to think about the first years and their perspectives.</p><p><strong>We have always witnessed ingenuity from Yuvaan's end. How does the team brew up such creative concepts and such great ideas? What goes behind the decision-making process?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshitizraj\"><strong>Kshitiz Raj</strong></a><strong> (</strong><i><strong>Treasurer</strong></i><strong>): </strong>It is the work of the team members who work together and come up with great ideas, with different points of view and thought processes. The diversity that we have in Yuvaan is what leads us to great ideas. People from different years, and from different colleges pitch in and I think this is the reason we are able to come up with different ideas about the themes.</p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>A healthy discussion is an important factor.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Every person has either heard or knows about Yuvaan, so whenever all of us sit down for a discussion, everyone puts forward different opinions and ideas, adding novel ideas to the discussion.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With everyone pitching their opinions, along with everyone else adding on to it, you put together something that you would have never thought of. And this is because this visualisation in the end isn’t an outcome of just one person’s opinions, but it is a mixture of various opinions and perspectives. As the final idea is a mix of everyone’s ideas, the mixture results in something huge, something which you had never thought of.</p><p><strong>Ney: ‘</strong>More the merrier’ is an important venture when it comes to discussing ideas. It isn’t just my fest, it is everyone's fest so we want everyone to contribute to Yuvaan. So everyone participates in the decision making process. There is no particular process, but we keep the ideas coming in and then we settle on a decision unanimously.</p><p><strong>Ebani: </strong>One point about brainstorming is that there is no hierarchy. It is totally flat in nature. Even a volunteer's point of view is taken into consideration as much as that of a council member. We just need to keep in mind what the authorities would not allow. Yet for effective brainstorming, everyone is involved. So we have a lot of meetings to just sit down and think about a lot of ideas.</p><p><strong>What were some ‌responsibilities that you had to undertake as a member of this council? What were some ‌responsibilities that you felt were a transformative experience for all of you?</strong></p><p><strong>Kshitiz: </strong>Being a treasurer, I’d say managing funds during the fest is itself a huge responsibility.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>During the 3-day fest, I must have felt like the governor of RBI.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I would say that managing funds, managing the people from different colleges and DTU students, managing the volunteers and the events which are happening is an enormous responsibility in itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ebani: </strong>I think realising where things can potentially go wrong and fixing it early is a responsibility.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The frequency of hurdles we had throughout the journey has helped me come out as a much more patient person since I have to understand and analyse ‌every person's opinion.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I can't simply disrespect the person's idea. So we have to respect each and every person. It just calms you down overall.</p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>I would say that there wasn’t any particular responsibility, personally speaking. Even the smallest of things that we think can create a lot of issues in the future. So we point them out and manage them.</p><p><strong>What are some of the steps you took to maximise the traction? How do you deal with any undesirable interruptions or any challenges during the event?</strong></p><p><strong>Meetali: </strong>It is important to understand the target audience. The next thing is targeting and reaching out to them in various ways like social media, mails, collaborating with their college societies, partnerships, etc.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Along with that, communication is important. Communication gaps will never help you solve any interruptions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I remember we had several emergency meetings to solve the issues. So, communicating with the entire council, each of whom will have a different idea to solve an issue. And then we can conclude to find an optimal way.</p><p><strong>Ney: </strong>Handling the interruptions by listening. Generally, there is a reason behind it. Best way to deal with it is to listen and not react imprudently. Think about it before you react and then process it. And then take whatever appropriate action needs to be taken. This is something I learned as a fest secretary.</p><p><strong>Ebani: </strong>You need to realise if there is a reason for the problem and think about how you can actually tackle that and hit the bull’s eye. Presence of mind plays a crucial role and you need to realise what is the need of the hour and how you can handle it accordingly.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>You need to solve the problem in the most efficient manner by being calm, because the frequency of such undesirable events is very high.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>As a council member, you realise that the responsibility is on you. So even if a volunteer makes a slight mistake, you are responsible for it. If a council member makes any mistake, then also you are responsible for it. So being calm and dealing with situations accordingly is an important factor one needs to take into account.</p><p><strong>Kshitiz: </strong>There is a saying that ‘Mountains move for a determined team’. And I think these four people present here eliminated any problem that came during the fest in these three years and I think that the teamwork that we have had was the main reason behind the elimination of every obstacle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Even as she was driving, she kept thinking of the fight, how she abruptly left in the middle of it, and how detached she felt at the moment. Upon reaching her parents’ home, she tried to continue with her routine, putting on a facade of indifference.&nbsp;</p><p><br>She came across her childhood room, and as she went through her old things, she thought, “I guess I was always the one to run away.” She recalled the time when as a kid, she used to keep playing with her toys even as she heard screaming voices from downstairs, trying as hard as possible to ignore them and act confident. “Why did I even do that?” she exclaimed, “Why didn’t I ever go down to see what was going on?”. She remembered how her younger brother used to feel scared hearing those noises but would calm down on seeing her act normal despite everything. “I couldn’t have left him alone, I guess.” She started tearing up as she recalled all those times when after putting her little brother to sleep, she cried in a corner, with a pillow in her mouth, trying to stifle any voice that might disturb him. “I wanted him to be safe … I wanted to be safe.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>After a couple of minutes, she wiped her tears and walked back to her car, still feeling hazy about her memories yet much lighter. She remembered how even when she saw her mother try to hide her bruises the morning after, she would pay no attention to it, as those bruises would bring back memories of the night before. “Why did I ignore those signs? … Why am I still trying to act tough?” She thought about the fight from before, how it all made sense that she ran away from it and how she acted aloof to her partner’s feelings. She called her partner up and said, “Hey! Let’s talk about today.”</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Could you briefly walk us through your experience in DCE as an undergraduate student? According to you, how has DCE impacted the various aspects of your life, both professionally and personally?</strong></p><p>I had an eventful and enriching experience while studying at&nbsp; DCE. My&nbsp; interactions with students from various backgrounds were extremely interesting and served to broaden my horizons.&nbsp; Joining DCE was not a pre-planned move from my side because there were no engineers in the family and I didn’t receive any guidance. It was only by chance that I filled up the admission form for DCE and got admitted into the engineering field. Getting educated in the DCE campus made me feel very proud because I was the first engineer in the family, and it groomed my personality. Now,&nbsp; I can proudly say that&nbsp; joining DCE was my destiny and&nbsp; best decision of my life, both&nbsp; personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>Any anecdotes you would like to share from that time?</strong></p><p>Our college life during those days was very disciplined and organised; there were simply no strikes or mass bunks! The atmosphere was conducive for studying with barely any distractions present nearby. We did have our fair share of fun, however, when we used to miss classes so that we could attend the International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan. College elections, which used to happen in September every year, too were an extremely enriching experience as they gave us the opportunity to interact with probable candidates from various backgrounds. Overall, DCE was more reminiscent of a school with class tests being conducted every Monday and Thursday. Some subjects, particularly Mechanical Drawing and Applied Mechanics, were a nightmare for students who had no previous knowledge of them, with most of us struggling to clear those papers. Group assignments were also a truly memorable experience as students used to work around the clock to finish their work as the deadline drew near.</p><p>A particularly memorable incident occurred while at a survey camp at Dehradun. Staying in an Ashram at Dehradun was a very pleasant experience which deepened the bond between classmates besides enriching knowledge. The entire class was divided in four to five groups to survey the Dehradun-Mussoorie Road. Our group did the survey but at the time of plotting the readings,&nbsp; the road which was supposed&nbsp; to go to a hill was going towards a&nbsp; valley.&nbsp; Alarm bells rang and each one of us went again early in the morning and worked again and finally got the right ( desired)&nbsp; readings.&nbsp; This is one of the most memorable experiences of studying in DCE.</p><p><strong>You have been recently honoured as the Woman Executive of the Year in the Oil and Gas Industry by FIPI. What factors would you credit as being the driving force behind this achievement?</strong></p><p>I think my sincerity towards my job and my adaptability have been very important virtues. I am a Civil Engineer, basically, but I've been posted to various departments in IndianOil - in projects, training, administration, ministry coordination, handling materials and contracts, and for the last two years I have been handling shipping, which is an entirely different field not many people are conversant with. My posting in the Shipping Department was at a time when COVID-19 had just started and I was trying to learn the basics of Shipping.&nbsp; There was a major challenge to maintain the supply of Crude Oil (major raw material) for our business to various refineries.&nbsp; In spite of all the hardships and challenges, there was no break in the supply of Crude Oil and the company continued its business as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, one of our huge carriers of crude caught fire near the Sri Lankan coast. Had those two million barrels of crude spilled in the sea, it would have been a major catastrophe from both the environmental and diplomatic point of view; the Sri Lankan economy is driven by tourism and had there been a spillage in the sea, it would have been disastrous.The engine of the vessel was totally damaged and there were doubts on its structural safety. A huge exercise was conducted for dousing the fire with the help of the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guards, Sri Lankan Authorities and IOCL, a process&nbsp; which&nbsp; took almost a week. The casualty ship was towed by 7-8 tugboats and taken to a port in UAE after which it was transferred to some small vessels. This was a very tedious exercise because testing the structural stability of the ship enroute, a journey of more than two thousand nautical miles, was a challenge and many countries were involved during the journey. These included The Maldives, Oman and UAE, and diplomatic permissions were required. This was a very challenging task which we ultimately handled in time and managed to save crude worth Rs. 674 crore while averting a major potential environmental disaster.</p><p>Further, during the pandemic, a shortage of oxygen was felt all over the country.&nbsp; In compliance with our company’s motto of <i>‘Pehle India Phir Oil’,</i>&nbsp; we arranged oxygen tankers from Singapore, airlifting some and transporting others through ships during the tough times when Oxygen was in acute shortage all over the country. I credit the senior management and the&nbsp; team of the Shipping Department who supported me in handling these challenges. I, along with my senior team members did not miss a single day in office in spite of the COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you overcome these ordeals?</strong></p><p>I think a few things are very important, the first being sincerity and adaptability and the other, believing in yourself. Wherever you go, create your own brand value. Everyone does a routine job but you must do something different which distinguishes you from the others. I always tell my colleagues and the people who work with me to create their own brand value.</p><p><strong>You've been a part of Indian Oil for almost 40 years at this point and you've worked for a variety of domains and projects. Is there one that you find particularly fascinating? And if so, why?</strong></p><p>A project which is very close to my heart is the implementation of access control systems across all locations. This initiative was taken in 2003-2004 and at that time, biometrics were very remote in PSUs and government organizations with people in general not being very pleased about the system of entering and punching. It was very important to implement this system to ensure punctuality and then to find a suitable&nbsp; technology to be implemented which would further survive another 30-40 years. I was inducted into a particular group because of this project, and I am very proud to say that this project was implemented successfully at 400 locations of IndianOil. We selected the technology which is still working across all locations.</p><p>Another important project was a grassroot Panipat refinery project for which I was associated right from the time we were selecting the land and getting the depository works done through the state ministries, township planning, refinery planning and further commissioning activities; commissioning is the time when a lot of activities happen at the site and even at the headquarters. I am very proud to be associated with the Panipat refinery project. This refinery is standing tall and one of the most modern refineries present in the country today.&nbsp; As a materials and contracts head, I have faced many challenges like arranging things for various time bound projects. In any project, 60-70% of the work is procurement of materials and tendering. If you achieve that in time, the projects will also be completed in time. I have handled procurement for projects worth more than&nbsp; one lakh crores&nbsp; in IndianOil as well as smoothly facilitated the implementation of various GOI&nbsp; policies like GeM, MSME and Public Procurement Policy. Our organization received the Super Buyer Award for implementing GeM policy and the first prize for implementing the MSME guidelines in the public sector. Implementing these policies was also a great challenge.</p><p><strong>You also mentioned that you faced a variety of challenges as one of the few female engineers in your organization and had to juggle the responsibilities of motherhood with your professional commitments. How did you overcome these hurdles?</strong></p><p>When I look back on the years, I can say it was definitely not very easy for me to come this far . I was married into an orthodox family which was not conversant with the pressures faced by a working woman. I had to balance&nbsp; my domestic and professional roles which put immense pressure on me mentally and physically. While taking care of two young children with a challenging job, I often felt like leaving my job because the demands of the home were so much more. My mother and husband were a great support to me during that time. My mother was a principal of a government school and we were groomed in an atmosphere where the ladies of the house were working. Her continuous emotional support and motivation kept me going. The only reason I am here today is because of&nbsp; my mother’s consistent encouragement&nbsp; .</p><p>During this period, my husband also provided tremendous support in&nbsp; handling tough situations with me. We were also lucky enough to avail the services of good house-helps. A part of the credit for my success goes to my house-helps as well; because of them, I could do certain things and devote much more time in the office. But yes, those five to six years during which my children were young were really tough.</p><p>One thing I would like to convey, particularly to working women, is to never let people feel that you would leave your work in between when the domestic need arises. You must make sure that you complete whatever job you take despite the domestic requirements.. Dependability is very important in a career as seniors will not give responsibility to a person who is not dependable.&nbsp; Children must know the importance of the work you are doing and the accompanying benefits that result when both the parents are working. Sub-delegate your responsibilities; ensure that your husband and children also contribute to the functioning of the house.</p><p><strong>Were there any particular challenges you faced in the workplace considering the male-dominated environment present in your organization at that time?</strong></p><p>Yes, there were many challenges as I joined a male dominated field.&nbsp; When I joined the Mathura refinery, I was the only woman working there. At that time, colleagues were not used to having women at work and basic facilities like ladies toilets were absent. Particularly during outside tours and training, women were never consulted and decisions made on their behalf&nbsp; presuming that it will be difficult for them to leave home. As a result many good opportunities to visit various places and learn new skills were missed out. The situation at the workplace too was extremely challenging. It was difficult to find company even during the commute to the office as colleagues would find it difficult to mingle with their female counterparts. It was extremely lonely staying away from home for the first time and in a male dominated area.</p><p>My first job was to handle contracts and tendering and my boss was extremely protective of me, so much so that he refused to let me face contractors for opening the tenders.. The consequence of this was that I started developing an inferiority complex; I started to feel that I was being left out of some important tasks just because I am a lady. After 2-3 years, I started working under a different boss who asked me to open a tender. I had to tell him that I was unaware about the process, having never experienced it before. He then deputed a colleague to guide me during one or two tenders, following which I took up the responsibility myself. During my journey, I was guided by many such mentors who shaped my journey in Indian Oil and acted as pillars of support.</p><p>There were many such problems on the way. Initially, since the number of female officers were very less, there were incidents in which one of my bosses would get up and open the door of his cabin whenever I was present inside. I used to feel very bad about it initially. However, as the confidence between us grew and the situation changed, things took a turn for the better. I am very happy to say that I get along very well with my male colleagues and I don’t find any difference while working with them.</p><p><strong>During your extensive career, what changes have you observed in the situation of women in the workplace?</strong></p><p>Gradually, things are improving now as more women are joining these organizations with the mindset of male colleagues also changing in keeping pace with this new reality. Women are now posted in every department, including night shifts. The facilities offered to women at the unit-level and the plant-level have also increased proportionally.</p><p>In the earlier days, women engineers were not&nbsp; assigned shift duties. Nowadays, they are deputed for night shifts and other male dominated departments. These women&nbsp; are confident and smart; they are working as location incharges, in bottling plants and inside the refineries. It is extremely heartening to see them doing well in every field. Our organization is providing them with a large number of facilities as well and we are very proactive about the development of women and inclusive growth. We have many programs dedicated to furthering female leadership. Whenever there are any foreign training programs, 20-30% women are always deputed for these programs. This provides women with a large number of opportunities for their growth. We have a networking module called <i>Maitreyi</i> which is a&nbsp; platform for women to come together to interact and guide each other and also have knowledge sharing sessions.</p><p>Overall, I’m quite happy with the way my organization is working towards women empowerment. The refineries division of IOCL is now going to be headed by a female director which is a very proud moment&nbsp; for all the women of IOCL.</p><p><strong>Over the years, there has been a radical shift in the career aspirations of many young professionals. With a lot of them opting to work in the private sector or choosing to move abroad for higher studies, the appeal of a job in the public sector seems to have lessened. According to you, what initiatives should be taken by public sector companies to make them more attractive to young professionals?</strong></p><p>I think that because the young professionals of today are smarter and more digitized, the old ways of working will not appeal to them anymore. Companies need to become smarter to keep pace with this change. Even small things like attire or the way people conduct themselves is very different in a private sector company.</p><p>As far as remuneration is concerned, that is another big draw that attracts people to a private sector company. In a PSU, we are governed by government guidelines and cannot pay our employees as much as private sector companies do. Nevertheless, the job security and perks that one receives in a PSU cannot be weighed in money and are very important indeed. In the past 2-3 years, however, even PSUs have become very lucrative considering the lockdowns and layoffs that took place during that period. Youngsters from IITs and IIMs are also joining IOCL and day by day, PSUs are becoming more and more competitive and at par with their counterparts in the private sector. Even in our interactions with licensors and other private parties and in our discussions with them, we find that they are impressed by the way we do our jobs.</p><p><strong>Do you feel that things would be even better if more PSUs encouraged the culture of research among the young professionals joining them?</strong></p><p>I think that these days, almost all PSUs have their R&amp;D divisions which promote research. The Prime Minister of India started a policy in which we give support to researchers and new startups. I think this is definitely very helpful.</p><p>Here in IOCL, we have a very big R&amp;D setup with new licensing technologies. In fact, we have even provided these technologies to other organizations. We are doing very well in the sustainable environment field with the focus on biofuels, CNG, ethanol and hydrogen. There are a variety of new fields of research to attract youngsters to them.</p><p><strong>Finally, what advice would you like to give to students who wish to achieve success in their respective fields? Is there a mantra for success that you personally follow?</strong></p><p>According to me, there is no particular mantra or recipe for success. The only important things are self-belief, sincerity, adaptability and creating our own brand value. My experiences during my career corroborate this fact.</p><p>Skill upgradation and diversifying the portfolio as per need is also very important because the requirements of the trade are changing at supersonic speed and unless we keep pace with changing scenarios, we will be left out in the race.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "slug": "ku-leuven-internship-experience-832",
    "body": "<p><i><strong>Vishal Sharma, Electrical Engineering, Class of 2021, shares his virtual internship experience at KU Leuven, Belgium, as a Hardware Research Intern.</strong></i></p><p>Back in November 2019, I decided to pursue a master’s in science at a top-ranked university after my bachelor’s. In a bid to diversify my resume, I began searching for a research internship. Having completed multiple iterations of Mars rover prototypes as a part of Team Inferno DTU, I was quite familiar with the concept of research and its methodologies, so I began to seek research opportunities outside India.</p><p>Around that time, I came to know about Mitacs (Canada), and that excited me a little. It was heart-breaking to find out that you needed at least 8 GPA to make the cut, whereas my GPA at the time was 7.94. I began hunting for similar programmes in India and abroad, and all of them required 8.5+ GPA. Some programmes like DAAD (Germany) and SN Bose (US) even needed 9.0+. Selections in these programmes hinge majorly on your GPA, with preference being given to those from IIT’s. Reality hit me hard.</p><p>Nevertheless, I continued my quest for a research internship and applied to every program I could find, with the hopes that my research experience would make up for my GPA. I applied to OIST (Japan), IST Austria, University of Helsinki, CERN, EPFL, and countless other programs. Each program required a statement of purpose, a resume and two letters of recommendation from either professors or employers (internships mentors count here). I did not have a dearth of professors who were willing to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. However, these programmes required the professors to submit these letters using a link that would be sent to them, and this was just asking for too much. Inferno’s faculty advisor, Prof. P. K. Jain was kind enough to meet most of the deadlines. As for the other professors, the job was easier said than done.</p><p>After countless rejections, I got screened for the first time by a professor under the TEEP@AsiaPlus programme in Taiwan. I was directed to write a few essays about my academic background, research experience, and fields of interest. I was then shortlisted for an interview by laboratories at two different Universities in Taiwan. These were the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Vision Lab at Tamkang University and the Process System Engineering, Process Optimisation, Process Simulation Lab at National Chung Hsing University. The interviews were held on Skype, and they discussed my resume for the most part. I was offered a two-month summer internship with a modest stipend of NT$ 10,000/month (around ₹ 25,000 PM) and accommodation. I accepted Tamkang’s offer because they were developing long-range UAVs, a field in which I had some experience, while NCHU was working on battery compositions, a role more suitable for chemical engineers.</p><p>After receiving my first internship offer, I felt confident and decided to find universities with research groups operating in the fields of robotics, electronics, and embedded systems. Once I had jotted down a list, I wrote emails to the professors heading these groups. I was honest and direct in my emails. A few of the professors reverted, others did not. In fact, only a few had the funds to support a 2-month summer internship.</p><p>A professor from KU Leuven, Belgium showed interest in my profile. KU Leuven ranks among the top 50 universities worldwide and is one of the most sought-after universities in Europe. I was interviewed twice by two PhD scholars on topics related to robotics, and I was given a task to prepare a preliminary research report on nano drones. Ultimately, I was selected. They offered a handsome stipend of €900 per month (about ₹ 80,000 pm) along with medical and travel insurance. I could not have been more excited.</p><h3>Covid-19 Breakout</h3><p>Even before I could apply for a visa, COVID-19 broke out. The pandemic hit Europe hard, and flight restrictions were imposed. The paperwork for the visa had already begun, but soon it was no longer possible to go there. Every research programme was cancelled, including MITACS, CERN, etc. A few of them started remotely like the Max Planck Institute. I was extremely upset. I had two offers, and I could not attend even one.</p><p>Fortunately, the professor at KU Leuven reached out to me and informed me they have deferred my internship offer to whenever it became possible to travel again. She also asked me if I wanted to collaborate remotely for the time being. I believed that even though it might not be as good as visiting the heart of Europe, it was still something, so I agreed.</p><h3>(Remote) Hardware Research Internship: First of its Kind</h3><p>My internship orientation was scheduled for 15th May. I was introduced to the project, which was to develop an Autonomous Nano Drone. This project was developed initially at the Robotics and Perception Lab, ETH Zurich. Our aim was to improve the performance of the drone. After preliminary research, we decided to achieve the goal by implementing a multi-camera array for visual feedback in the drone. I was part of a team supervised by <i>Prof. Verhelst</i> along with two PhD scholars, <i>Mr. Nimish Shah</i> and <i>Mr. Steven Colleman</i>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NqmA1NVlgfg2id_aMZ7Bt-idpt41O6iaFvaxiPyub0hJlliR8YpBRIt-x-02dk3npl_uOP6T1TZcUKLzds-qa6HLrSDXTMpVupSU64_NnVMsAtHXvrHzkpAEs5uy5IS_9QBGUM1s96lOVRwRIgKWuXHng7of0_lC_OGjaAwN1JFS9Ad4_--nTkeL\"></figure><p>However, the big question remained unanswered. How can we do this remotely? Don’t we need actual hardware to work? Does KU Leuven have the required resources and online infrastructure to facilitate the internship?</p><p>All my questions were answered as soon as my guest ID was created.</p><h3>The Intranet</h3><p>There is a separate intranet for each department in KU Leuven. This intranet is basically a hub to access the innumerable resources the university has to offer. The intranet has features such as Publication Tool, EDA Software (Any paid software you can think of), Rapid PCB Prototyping (Submit a PCB design, collect the PCB a week later) and so on.</p><p>The two resources I used most were: remote access to Linux or Windows servers &amp; workstations and remote access to all the popular, cutting-edge FPGA development boards available.</p><p>To give you a perspective, they have eight extremely powerful Linux Servers and over a hundred Linux and Windows workstations, with top-end specifications, running 24/7. All of these have proprietary software such as <i>Altium</i>, <i>MATLAB</i>, <i>Simulink</i>, <i>Solidworks</i>, and <i>Ansys </i>pre-installed. Each user has a fast, virtual drive deployed as a samba server, and it is accessible in these workstations.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AryRLD_tQJF40Bn5LwAX75dmfJXQG0SQSNtZV2ZMyg6oZh6ZHQbJMOllYHaM1Z_VWL_tlZ78KmJDhb_sv5YtKy_-6Q5wg260Rkbm7d9Eus1qLq5btb06RJnOWTC6c9ktCN3UzM3p9GQK-LwowgPvGrQLPQNpPHHQm70n9EXPnqeLrK-P7R1TZUqW\"></figure><p>The available FPGA boards are connected to these workstations, so to access a particular board, all you need to do is log in to that workstation. Any new development board can be ordered just by filling a form available on the intranet, and it is delivered to the lab within a week.</p><p>I had worked in a research team at DTU but had never experienced such a research-driven environment where you are not limited by the resources. This place is genuinely a researcher’s paradise.</p><p>Regardless of these resources, we faced a few issues due to the work from home situation. The PhD scholars working with me could visit their offices in KU Leuven only once or twice a week, so even if we had to disconnect a peripheral from the system, we had to wait for a few days. Also, the operating system running on these Linux servers was CentOS. At this point, I had been using Ubuntu for more than 2 years as my primary OS, but still, CentOS had its own problems. I developed all the preliminary code base on my laptop but found many compatibility issues with CentOS later on. Moreover, since these servers were shared resources, nobody had administration privileges, which made everything a bit more difficult.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zsIMQx8WEL31dozCkm9YtvPNytfa3PNRbVsbrOApcpX66MamUnAgWA2Rv4HFK07cW0vm6BVhnovvwdlnFcns073sFKi0JAwyiv8_fVgANTsmznSDMkBE-eA3ni_8aMIlZER4o64RTeK1f3sCgEgb9-aNKMIdkAAfNWg0xfTCweTLDIviDfnJ9m8W\"></figure><p>To provide IT support, KU Leuven has implemented an IT Helpdesk which never goes offline. Once, I could not log in into the server because I had inadvertently changed the “bashrc” file in the Linux server. My issue was resolved within 12 hours. As for the other issues I faced, I received timely help from my mentors.</p><h3>The Weekly Meetings</h3><p>We held a weekly meeting every Wednesday to discuss my progress and the challenges I faced. Being the only intern among PhD scholars, I often felt out of place, but everyone was very welcoming and helpful. The people I worked with tremendously increased my interest in a master’s degree.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r9zvly2aE54MNiUOJCm4fh_AHFThW15XFkLrp3SDcgPj_Od90ZQVZT021nNmZfrq6ZWeZ3UbSQeDhRuLFY3EZyNOzpim1GLyef6JuWFxUlO4NEGX7i6gZvWjWZ8AifBIWtUytZrsa71_IuVoBI-7eraRhlubGIPKULyyEXcDoISxpQ_OAkWXQ-wS\"></figure><p>Moreover, Slack served as a platform to discuss anything and everything. I used it extensively to get help from these amazing people.</p><p>Fun fact: Apart from serious channels to discuss the project and other tech-related topics, they had a dedicated channel called <i>#random</i> just to share memes and silly stuff. Even professors shared hilarious memes on this channel.</p><h3>The Result</h3><p>The experience was nothing short of magical for me. Not even in my wildest dreams, had I imagined working on a cutting-edge research project from my home. I learned a lot and experienced, first-hand, how research should be done. The most important lessons I learned were consistency, self-management, and the power of routine &amp; discipline.</p><p>My GitHub activity from those two months is something I look back upon with pride.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aXAngQneHU7szFncdNmgFgMTWWlqOy7_eArz8rKvk3AL-2jmW-r-qATT8RRDSTVJSlgrQ8g6pXagi6dZoPe0GIwDvLLeRyQdYv5AM5aLoJMnWicOZbjiqqP_i2VMrhliC8rH3GcSfv2dYZ2KgHmt3yrVWRundAoVmJIH-N8OnCd8BqKy9QGyZYUP\"></figure><p>Here is the link to my project repository, please have a look if you are curious about the project:</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/VishalSharma0309/nano_drone\">https://github.com/VishalSharma0309/nano_drone</a></p><p>Since my invitation as an international visiting scholar has been deferred to the winter break, I hope the global situation improves, so I can visit KU Leuven in the upcoming winter. I can only imagine how enriching and fruitful the on-site experience would be.</p><h3>A Few Takeaways</h3><p>After having traversed the perilous journey of securing a research internship, here are a few points that you should keep in mind before you embark on the same journey.</p><ol><li>Aim for the Top 300<br>Our university sponsors research internships to some extent (mostly travel fare and visa). However, the university inviting you must be among the top three hundred institutions&nbsp;</li><li>Follow a schedule while mailing<br>Try sending out emails such that they are received around 9-10 AM on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at the target university. Absolutely avoid weekends! Trust me, this works.</li><li>Personalise Emails<br>Avoid using the same email for everything. Modify your e-mails according to the research focus of the particular faculty. Use the name of the professor in the salutation. Do not cc or even bcc these mails.</li><li>Deadlines<br>For a summer research internship, the programme deadlines usually start in November with the majority of them in January. Try submitting your application a week before the actual deadline, that will give you ample time to get your recommendation letters submitted in time. Similarly, start sending out emails in January for a summer internship.</li><li>Devote Time to your Resume, SoPs and LoRs<br>These carry a lot of weightage and it takes time to get them right. Don’t sell yourself short on these, but don’t make up stuff. You will have to modify these for each program.</li><li>Finalise your “Recommenders” before-hand<br>Contact at least two professors or internship mentors well in advance and tell them that they will have to send out quite a few recommendation letters on your behalf. Try drafting these LoR’s on your own before contacting them.</li><li>CGPA Matters<br>When I was applying, I had a CGPA of 7.94, while many programs had a minimum requirement of 8. So, yes, CGPA matters but so does research experience. Once shortlisted, your knowledge and experience are all that counts. Nevertheless, maintain a 7+ CGPA.</li><li>Be Perseverant<br>Don’t lose hope if you get rejected. In my experience, you will secure an interview for every 10 internships programs you apply to and get a reply for every 50 emails you send out.</li><li>Corporate vs Research Internship<br>First, decide whether you want to pursue an internship in a company or an institution. If you are looking to pursue an MS, a research internship is a good option.

    "body": "<p><strong>How have you seen the field of Computer Vision and Robotics evolve over the years?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\" One of the most remarkable achievements was the incorporation of Machine Learning.\"</p></blockquote><p>When you’re a part of the journey, you don’t notice much. But the key changes that have taken place are the resources that are required have increased multifold. When I was a graduate student doing object detection, we were looking at wildlife through aerial sensors and it would take us days to get the results. But today when the students perform such analyses, it gives vast results in no time. Prof. Raj Reddy, a pioneer in Robotics and Computer Vision, had a philosophy that the dissertation results weren’t accurate unless they worked on 4 different types of images. That time it was a rigid thing, but today we perform experiments on large datasets of images. One of the most remarkable achievements was the incorporation of Machine Learning. Earlier, we used predefined features, which needed specific knowledge of the data. Today we have data for every feature available for learning.</p><p><strong>Collaboration between academia and industry is very important. In San Diego, as shown in your lecture, you’ve collaborated with industry giants. But in India, we seldom find such collaborations and the existing ones are too limited. What are your views on this?</strong></p><p>I think everybody realises that we have the same objectives at a higher level. But we have different expertise and infrastructure. Unless we really put it all together, we cannot solve the problem and nobody wins. So once people have developed some trustworthy relationships, good things will start happening. The industry also is hiring students from universities, so they have a very good idea of happenings inside the universities. The task is the same but the difference in an industry is that there it is commercial and profit-making. The freedom to think freely might not be available in the industry. But if you know people with similar ideas and thinking, you’ll feel comfortable being and working with them.</p><p><strong>It is often said that students need to be motivated to pursue research? Do you really think a motivating factor is needed, or this should come from within?</strong></p><p>Most successful students I’ve seen have a high amount of self-motivation. Whenever I need to bring in new students, I tell them to interact with other students in the group because peer-to-peer interaction is very important. It might not be necessary for some theorist like Ramanujan, with high thinking skills, but this isn’t the case with us. We certainly want to emphasise that people are respectful of others ideas and help out each other. People understand that I might be helping you today, and you might help me tomorrow. People then enjoy working and collaborating.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest challenge that the Robotics industry still faces even today?</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"... works in real-life with continuous interaction, without humans feeling threatened\"</p></blockquote><p>Safety, Robustness, Generalisation and Human Centeredness. I believe that making one-of-a-kind is no big deal, but making it robust and able to work in a variety of situations as well as interact with humans is very important, and hasn’t been yet achieved. There are a lot of open issues left unresolved. A robot that works in an artificial environment is not needed; what’s required is one which works in real-life with continuous interaction, without humans feeling threatened or stressed.</p><p><strong>What final message would you like to give to the students?</strong></p><p>I am very impressed and glad to visit DTU. I really wish a large number of students from here contribute to the community of Robotics and Intelligent Systems. I’m sure you’ll be successful. I want to re-emphasise that particularly in this field you might end up building something life-saving. I wish you all the best!</p>",

The application is straightforward, requiring details of work experience and achievements. If your resume is shortlisted, you get invited to an assessment centre. This is an invitation to an online interview process consisting of various technical and behavioural rounds of 1 hour each determining troubleshooting skills based on CS Fundamentals, programming and leadership principles.</p><p>After getting my resume shortlisted, I too appeared for the assessment feeling a little nervous. On 4th November 2021 (the day of Diwali!), I received a call from an international number which I missed out on picking up since I thought it was a spam call. I finally answered the phone when I received multiple calls from the same number. It was the EMEA Recruiter on the other line saying, <strong>\"</strong><i><strong>We are happy to offer you a Software Engineering Internship in our Glasgow office for the summer of 2022.\"</strong> </i>&nbsp;I went berserk after what I heard and told my mom first about this news. She made me believe that it was real and I accepted the offer.</p><p><strong>PRE- INTERNSHIP EFFORTS</strong></p><p>Since the application required insights into the applicant’s resume, work experiences and social media links, I always tried to <strong>document my journey</strong> and experiences on my social media profiles and volunteered for programmes that elevated the representation of women in tech fields.&nbsp;</p><p>During the same month, I also participated in and won the <strong>Code for Good Hackathon EMEA 2021</strong>, which provided me with good insight into software engineering in the firm through my mentors.</p><p><a href=\"https://careers.jpmorgan.com/US/en/students/programs/code-for-good?search=&amp;tags=location__AsiaPacific__India\">Code for Good</a> is a series of Hackathons hosted in JPMorgan's global technology centres. During this event, participants spend 12–24 hours with the company's employees, developing creative solutions to help non-profits tackle real-world problems.</p><p>Since it was an on-site internship, there was a long process for obtaining a UK Visa and eventually completing all the onboarding formalities. Due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, the immigration process for several European countries was severely impacted, which resulted in the late issuing of our visas. Still, the immigration team at JPMorgan handled everything effortlessly and with utmost efficiency. Before my internship started, <strong>I connected with my mentors and the team via LinkedIn to get familiarized with the tech stack and the project.</strong></p><p><strong>FINALLY, FROM DELHI TO GLASGOW!</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oQd4407ASqGic4WOz9Aw41xu-Nr7oudf_6wQXOm18ZSoEdJ4iz2q9e1DWCDNHQgWjnQkyQv-dwrV0O-kTldnR-8t23fS9eqHXvxpSICcFinSY9hrWrrSA8K_7S77aJJeVTr3fLXpAE9lH8i5Qr2BPZw0R6ocH_1kiXohDdn7x14kCtdMk0akSoqZjA\"></figure><p>I landed at the Glasgow International Airport on 16th June, and the first thing that I noticed was the pleasant weather!

I worked in the <strong>Onboarding Team for Asset and Wealth Management</strong>, where my project focused on <strong>creating widgets and metrics to track the growth and performance</strong> of the business using various frontend and backend frameworks. I was always interested in working on the client side of the business or the front office wherein the client’s needs and expectations are better understood to implement the solutions efficiently. Fortunately, my role came at the intersection of <strong>software development and business analysis.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My managers provided a comprehensive overview of the project at the beginning, which allowed me to navigate the work more effectively.

Fail better.”</strong></i></p><p>This quote perfectly summarises my experience of applying for internships and how every rejection was a redirection to something even better.&nbsp;</p><p>As the internship season nears, I reminisce about the time when I was indulged in meeting application deadlines, taking advice from seniors and clicking every link containing the word internship. My main motive for participating in internships was to get acquainted with the world of Information Technology and to gain exposure to the corporate sector.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/k-uAZKFkZHK8Ij8VuK_udSn2ssp8csgu7lCZna-kg2qLgcdGtrwb9LilA0KcN5S5bXRIIQFMC1Gwq13u3kCduUqLfC5j2qirfa4lpCx4OdER4K2pVZsICnbKH2EJiDK2dM5fhMHFSLWENITvZrKfllDbzr-LNbgkyJqd9gH2pTifsSEyju-UWQk_XQ\"></figure><p><i><strong>My fellow interns and the campus recruitment team who made it what it was!</strong></i></p><p><strong>Eligibility: </strong>The internship is <strong>open for full-time third-year undergraduates in computer science or related branches </strong>enrolled in a university for the academic year 2022-23.</p><p>I applied for the 2021 EMEA Software Engineering Internship at Glasgow directly through their Careers website. The application is straightforward, requiring details of work experience and achievements. If your resume is shortlisted, you get invited to an assessment centre. This is an invitation to an online interview process consisting of various technical and behavioural rounds of 1 hour each determining troubleshooting skills based on CS Fundamentals, programming and leadership principles.</p><p>After getting my resume shortlisted, I too appeared for the assessment feeling a little nervous. On 4th November 2021 (the day of Diwali!), I received a call from an international number which I missed out on picking up since I thought it was a spam call. I finally answered the phone when I received multiple calls from the same number. It was the EMEA Recruiter on the other line saying, <strong>\"</strong><i><strong>We are happy to offer you a Software Engineering Internship in our Glasgow office for the summer of 2022.\"</strong> </i>&nbsp;I went berserk after what I heard and told my mom first about this news. She made me believe that it was real and I accepted the offer.</p><p><strong>PRE- INTERNSHIP EFFORTS</strong></p><p>Since the application required insights into the applicant’s resume, work experiences and social media links, I always tried to <strong>document my journey</strong> and experiences on my social media profiles and volunteered for programmes that elevated the representation of women in tech fields.&nbsp;</p><p>During the same month, I also participated in and won the <strong>Code for Good Hackathon EMEA 2021</strong>, which provided me with good insight into software engineering in the firm through my mentors.</p><p><a href=\"https://careers.jpmorgan.com/US/en/students/programs/code-for-good?search=&amp;tags=location__AsiaPacific__India\">Code for Good</a> is a series of Hackathons hosted in JPMorgan's global technology centres. During this event, participants spend 12–24 hours with the company's employees, developing creative solutions to help non-profits tackle real-world problems.</p><p>Since it was an on-site internship, there was a long process for obtaining a UK Visa and eventually completing all the onboarding formalities. Due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, the immigration process for several European countries was severely impacted, which resulted in the late issuing of our visas. Still, the immigration team at JPMorgan handled everything effortlessly and with utmost efficiency. Before my internship started, <strong>I connected with my mentors and the team via LinkedIn to get familiarized with the tech stack and the project.</strong></p><p><strong>FINALLY, FROM DELHI TO GLASGOW!</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oQd4407ASqGic4WOz9Aw41xu-Nr7oudf_6wQXOm18ZSoEdJ4iz2q9e1DWCDNHQgWjnQkyQv-dwrV0O-kTldnR-8t23fS9eqHXvxpSICcFinSY9hrWrrSA8K_7S77aJJeVTr3fLXpAE9lH8i5Qr2BPZw0R6ocH_1kiXohDdn7x14kCtdMk0akSoqZjA\"></figure><p>I landed at the Glasgow International Airport on 16th June, and the first thing that I noticed was the pleasant weather!

    "slug": "texas-instruments-internship-experience-225",
    "body": "<p><strong>The Preparation</strong></p><p>Before April 2022, I was heavily involved in coding. But then, after I organized a webinar regarding core placements with one of my friends under Piyush Tewari Sir’s guidance, I became very enthusiastic about Core. There was something about it that pulled me in. Everything about it excited me. However, I was on the fence about whether or not to sit for core placements.</p><p>Given that we only had a couple of months left before the intern season started, I was quite anxious. I contacted one of my friends, Mandeep, and the conversation with him propelled me to at least try for the core companies. He assured me that it would be worthwhile to at least prepare from my end.</p><p>I hustled for the next 2 months. I started with Digital Electronics, as that is often considered as one of the more challenging subjects. I scoured through many YouTube playlists and made sure to make a summary sheet for each unit. Similarly, for Analog Electronics, I revised my notes and watched YouTube playlists. I made sure to focus on my notes and revised them regularly and my Verilog-related lab work. To enhance my CV, I worked on 3 projects in the summer.</p><p>Before the Qualcomm exam, I practised multiple aptitude tests using YouTube. I was hoping that I would get selected for the next round but failed to clear the OA. That hit me hard and demoralized me. I tried not to let it deter me and gave OA for Texas Instruments on 4th August with full preparation. The results were announced close to midnight and I was selected for the interview round!</p><p><strong>The Interview</strong></p><p>My interview was scheduled for the following day, August 5th. Around 6 PM, I received the call for my interview. We started with some polite introductions and then he began the interview by asking me about flip-flops. Most people would advise you to outline the procedure, provide thorough explanations and give extensive information, but I immediately drew the conclusion and that set the tone for my interview. The interviewer gave me a 10-page pdf, each with 2 questions per page. We went over each question individually and I provided answers to all the questions. Whenever I fumbled or got stuck, the interviewer would give me hints to guide me. Finally, I was probed about my academic projects.</p><p>Each interview is allotted a time slot of 45 minutes but in my case, it went well over 1.5 hours.&nbsp; I was told that HR would contact me later. By 9 PM, everyone started receiving their confirmations. I kept waiting but didn’t receive any call. I gathered I must have been rejected. That was heart-wrenching since I knew there were no more opportunities available on campus and even though my interview went very well, I was rejected. Everything felt overwhelming and I cried. However, when the final list was released and I was checking it to look for the people to extend my congratulations to, I found that I was also one of the selected candidates!</p><p>The limitless happiness I felt in that moment is indescribable, although I was still waiting for the HR to call me.</p><p>Intern Experience</p><p>I joined my internship on 16th May 2022 and worked for the High-Speed Signal Chain (HSSC) team under Jagadish Sakamuri Sir. The project I was assigned to was “Generate Test Code for ATE from Test Condition Matrix”. My responsibility was to write a script that, based on the test conditions, would first analyze the excel sheet that a tester engineer receives specifically for a device and then produce a test code programme for an automatic testing apparatus (ATE).</p><p>I initially found it challenging to even begin my assigned project. Considering that this was very different from the profile for which I was initially chosen. A friend of mine advised me that instead of focusing on the overall picture, attempt to evaluate each individual component of the project, learn about the necessary resources beforehand, and apply them side by side, just like you would with a typical college project. He advised me to divide my projects into multiple portions, and that helped me a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step was learning how to analyze an excel sheet. I performed a crash course in Python and Pandas in one evening, and then the following day (Day 2 of my internship), I began working on my projects. Within a week, I had finished 25% of my targets. I was terribly afraid that I would not be able to finish my tasks since data analysis and test code development were outside of my field of expertise. To compensate, I worked continuously through the nights.</p><p>Even though my target timeline suggested finishing the script by the end of the 7th week, I pushed ahead and completed the script by the fourth week. The only task left was to test the code on the tester platform.</p><p>On-Site</p><p>I received mail after my first two weeks of the internship stating that I am permitted to move this internship to an on-site internship. Since many didn’t have the same opportunity, I made sure to seize it. I feel that only on my first day on campus did I truly begin to learn.</p><p>I began working on site at Texas Instruments. You have no idea how anxious I was. But as soon as I stepped onto the campus, I realized that this is where I want to begin my corporate career. I don't know how to put into words the sensation I had. It was pure, unbridled joy for me. When I first introduced myself to my team, they corrected me, suggesting that I am now the tester engineer intern rather than the digital design intern.</p><p>One of my coworkers, Shivaranjni Devi Ma'am, led me to the tester lab where she gave me a lesson on the various ATE systems, how they test their products, and how much time they spend in the labs. The following day, my mentor showed up and showed me how to utilize the Eagle Testing System User Interface and how to determine whether a device is functioning properly. They also taught me how to use the ETS platform to test my test code.</p><p>The day I was supposed to have my midterm review, things didn't go as expected. The reason was that I was unable to sell my script and instead, I was attempting to educate my project in an improper manner. I received nearly full points for my midterm review, with the exception of the two marks that my team docked me for my presentation. I used to visit the tester lab every day with one of my teammates to learn more about the various ATE systems that were offered there. I completed three more projects over the course of the subsequent four weeks at the campus, all of which dealt with various ATE systems. I wrote the script for the development of test code for the ATE systems ETS364, V93K, and merging the tests. When my final term presentation took place, it went quite well. My mentor only deducted 1 mark this time.</p><p>Takeaway</p><p>Every day I learned something new from my team. I have the fondest memories from my time working with them. An honorary mention to my mentor, Jagadish Sakamuri Sir who has 17 years of expertise in this industry. He is one of the kindest people I have ever encountered. He would always ask for my input on a subject before offering his own. His enthusiasm and inquisitiveness and how he is never tired of learning new things are awe-inspiring. He made sure I wasn't just limited to working on my projects and helped me gain access to the tester lab, which is not authorized for interns.&nbsp;</p><p>Advice for juniors</p><ol><li>analyzing situations.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>For preparation in this core field, focus on topics like STA and FIFO as well and refer to Digital Electronics by Anand Kumar.</li></ul><p>Implement parallelly whatever you learn, this helps your knowledge grow.</p><p>Make sure to prepare revision notes that summarize each unit. This helps you a lot during your interview preparations.</p><p>CGPA matters a lot. Doesn’t matter the company, a good CGPA will take you to many places. Try to manage a 9+ CGPA.</p><ol><li><i><strong>Risk hai toh ishq hai</strong></i>. Sometimes, it is better to take risks after carefully</li></ol><p>It is never too late to start.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Harshal Chowdhary, ECE, Class of 2023, shares his internship experience at Texas Instruments, as a Tester Engineer(Digital Design).</strong></i></p><h4>The Preparation</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before April 2022, I was heavily involved in coding. But then, after I organized a webinar regarding core placements with one of my friends under Piyush Tewari Sir’s (Asst. Prof., ECE department) guidance, I became very enthusiastic about Core. There was something about it that pulled me in. Everything about it excited me. However, I was on the fence about whether or not to sit for core placements.</p><p>Given that we only had a couple of months left before the intern season started, I was quite anxious. I contacted one of my friends, Mandeep, and the conversation with him propelled me to at least try for the core companies. He assured me that it would be worthwhile to at least prepare from my end.</p><p>I hustled for the next 2 months. I started with Digital Electronics, as that is often considered one of the more challenging subjects. I scoured through many YouTube playlists and made sure to make a summary sheet for each unit. Similarly, for Analog Electronics, I revised my notes and watched YouTube playlists. I made sure to focus on my notes and revised them regularly and my Verilog-related lab work. To enhance my CV, I worked on 3 projects in the summer.</p><p>Before the Qualcomm exam, I practised multiple aptitude tests using YouTube. I was hoping that I would get selected for the next round but failed to clear the OA. That hit me hard and demoralized me. I tried not to let it deter me and gave OA for Texas Instruments on 4th August with full preparation. The results were announced close to midnight and I was selected for the interview round!</p><h4>The Interview</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My interview was scheduled for the following day, August 5th. Around 6 PM, I received the call for my interview. We started with some polite introductions and then he began the interview by asking me about flip-flops. Most people would advise you to outline the procedure, provide thorough explanations and give extensive information, but I immediately drew the conclusion and that set the tone for my interview. The interviewer gave me a 10-page pdf, each with 2 questions per page. We went over each question individually and I provided answers to all the questions. Whenever I fumbled or got stuck, the interviewer would give me hints to guide me. Finally, I was probed about my academic projects.</p><p>Each interview is allotted a time slot of 45 minutes, but in my case, it went well over 1.5 hours.&nbsp;I was told that HR would contact me later. By 9 PM, everyone started receiving their confirmations. I kept waiting but didn’t receive any call. I gathered I must have been rejected. That was heart-wrenching since I knew there were no more opportunities available on campus and even though my interview went very well, I was rejected. Everything felt overwhelming, and I cried. However, when the final list was released and I was checking it to look for the people to extend my congratulations to, I found that<strong> I was also one of the selected candidates!</strong></p><p>The limitless happiness I felt at that moment is indescribable, although I was still waiting for HR to call me.</p><h4>Intern Experience</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I joined my internship on 16th May 2022 and worked for the <strong>High-Speed Signal Chain (HSSC)</strong> team under Jagadish Sakamuri Sir. The project I was assigned to was<strong> “Generate Test Code for ATE from Test Condition Matrix”</strong>. My responsibility was to write a script that, based on the test conditions, would first analyze the excel sheet that a tester engineer receives specifically for a device and then produce a test code programme for an<strong> automatic testing apparatus (ATE).</strong></p><p>I initially found it challenging to even begin my assigned project. Considering that this was very different from the profile for which I was initially chosen. A friend of mine advised me that instead of focusing on the overall picture, attempt to evaluate each individual component of the project, learn about the necessary resources beforehand, and apply them side by side, just like you would with a typical college project. He advised me to divide my projects into multiple portions, and that helped me a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step was learning how to analyze an excel sheet. I performed a crash course in Python and Pandas in one evening, and then the following day (Day 2 of my internship), I began working on my projects. Within a week, I had finished 25% of my targets. I was terribly afraid that I would not be able to finish my tasks since data analysis and test code development were outside of my field of expertise. To compensate, I worked continuously through the nights.</p><p>Even though my target timeline suggested finishing the script by the end of the 7th week, I pushed ahead and <strong>completed the script by the fourth week</strong>. The only task left was to test the code on the tester platform.</p><h4>On-Site</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I received mail after my first two weeks of the internship stating that I am permitted to move this internship to an on-site internship. Since many didn’t have the same opportunity, I made sure to seize it. I feel that only on my first day on campus did I truly begin to learn.</p><p>I began working on-site at Texas Instruments. You have no idea how anxious I was. But as soon as I stepped onto the campus, I realized that this is where I want to begin my corporate career. I don't know how to put into words the sensation I had. It was pure, unbridled joy for me. When I first introduced myself to my team, they corrected me, suggesting that I am now the tester engineer intern rather than the digital design intern.</p><p>One of my coworkers, Shivaranjni Devi Ma'am, led me to the tester lab where she gave me a lesson on the various ATE systems, how they test their products, and how much time they spend in the labs. The following day, my mentor showed up and showed me how to utilize the Eagle Testing System User Interface and how to determine whether a device is functioning properly. They also taught me how to use the ETS platform to test my test code.</p><p>The day I was supposed to have my midterm review, things didn't go as expected. The reason was that I was unable to sell my script and instead, I was attempting to educate my project in an improper manner. I received nearly full points for my midterm review, with the exception of the two marks that my team docked me for my presentation. I used to visit the tester lab every day with one of my teammates to learn more about the various ATE systems that were offered there.<strong> I completed three more projects</strong> over the course of the subsequent four weeks at the campus, all of which dealt with various ATE systems. I wrote the script for the development of test code for the ATE systems ETS364, V93K, and merged the tests. When my final term presentation took place, it went quite well. My mentor only deducted 1 mark this time.</p><h4>Takeaway</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Every day I learned something new from my team.</strong> I have the fondest memories from my time working with them. An honorary mention to my mentor,<strong> Jagadish Sakamuri Sir</strong> who has 17 years of expertise in this industry. He is one of the kindest people I have ever encountered. He would always ask for my input on a subject before offering his own. His enthusiasm and inquisitiveness and how he is never tired of learning new things are awe-inspiring. He made sure I wasn't just limited to working on my projects and helped me gain access to the tester lab, which is not authorized for interns.&nbsp;</p><h4>Advice for juniors</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>It is never too late to start.</strong></li><li><i><strong>Risk hai toh ishq hai</strong></i><strong>. </strong>Sometimes, it is better to take risks after carefully analyzing<strong> </strong>situations.</li><li>CGPA matters a lot. Doesn’t matter the company, a good CGPA will take you to many places. Try to manage a 9+ CGPA.</li><li>Make sure to prepare revision notes that summarize each unit. This helps you a lot during your interview preparations.</li><li>Implement parallelly whatever you learn, this helps your knowledge grow.</li><li>For preparation in this core field, focus on topics like STA and FIFO as well and refer to Digital Electronics by Anand Kumar.</li></ol>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Ayush Sharma, SE, Class of 2023, shares his experience as a Deep Learning Research Intern at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.</strong></i></p><p><strong>ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP:</strong></p><p>Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore has a specialised team of professors and students working on natural language processing, known as <strong>NTU-SpeechLab</strong>. It comes under the department of computer science at NTU. I worked under the guidance of a Professor (unnamed), and his PhD students on building state of the art natural language processing models using deep learning techniques. Over the past few years, NTU Speechlab has been conducting cutting-edge NLP research and providing some state of the art solutions and, having contributed to this system, I am equally glad and proud to be associated with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During my internship at NTU, I worked on the task of text emotion recognition in conversation, i.e., identifying the emotion of the speaker (angry, happy, sad, etc) from the speaker's utterances (text dialogues) in the conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BEFORE THE INTERNSHIP:</strong></p><p>To get accepted into a research internship at one of the top computer science institutes in the world is not an easy task. They look into your complete profile ranging from your CGPA to the amount of experience you have in the field. It really helps your profile if you have publications or research papers before applying. But, I would like to tell you all that it is not completely a necessity to have publications, as I did not have any myself before applying! If you can make up for the lack of research papers by a strong profile, good internships and projects in the area for which you are applying, your chances of getting selected are as good as anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Before applying for this internship, I had already done a research internship with SystemOnSilicon Corporation, an Indo-US start-up based in San Francisco. There, I worked on similar machine learning problems, involving sequence models for predictions of crop prices in India for their apps. Also, I had learnt how to scrape data from websites, which became really useful while I was applying to NTU, Singapore. I had also done another internship at Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at the Scientific Analysis Group. Apart from that, I had an array of good open-source machine learning and natural language processing projects to show on my resume. I was also the founder and President of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Society of DTU (AIMS-DTU) which really showed my passion for the field of AI. All these small factors helped me build a strong profile while applying for the internship at NTU, Singapore.</p><p><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS:</strong></p><p>I applied for this internship in March by sending a direct email to the professor I wanted to work under, looking at his previous work in the field.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I would like to mention that while applying for research work, it is always good to see the previous work the mentor has done so that you can get a good idea about whether your interests and qualifications are relevant to the interests of your mentor.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>After my email, he replied back within 4-5 days, and set up an online interview with me. During the interview we discussed all of my past internships mentioned on my resume. He even looked at the code quality of all my projects on Github while sharing the screen and asked me questions regarding the ins and outs of those projects. A few mistakes were pointed out but overall, he seemed happy about my work. A few days later I was informed that I had been shortlisted for the further process. In this part, I was given a week to accomplish a task on my own. The task was to scrape websites and extract meaningful textual sentences from a website and all its children links, to create a large text corpus for language modelling. I managed to complete this task quite well and within the deadline. My work really impressed the Professor and I received the selection mail a week later in the last week of March!</p><p><strong>DURING THE INTERNSHIP:</strong></p><p>My topic of research was<strong> “Natural Language Processing”</strong> and the internship commenced in the first week of June. We had two weekly meetings in which we had to present our progress and also discuss the issues we faced. During the first phase of my internship, I was working with the language modelling team, extracting text corpuses from different sources to feed into the language modelling task. Then, after a few weeks I started working on my main project, with the Natural Language Understanding team, on an Emotion Recognition task. In this project my team had to create an NLP deep learning model which could take in a conversation between multiple speakers, and predict the emotion of each speaker after each dialogue. The emotion could be any one of the six–happy, angry, sad, frustrated, excited or neutral. We had multimodal data, i.e., audio, video and text to train the model on. It was a really exciting project and we achieved state of the art accuracy with our model. Moreover, I learned a great deal by getting hands-on experience of working with transformers (BERT, RoBERTa) and attention mechanisms in neural networks. All in all, it was a lot of fun!</p><p><strong>ADVICE FOR JUNIORS:</strong></p><p>If you want to land a research internship, the only advice would be to<strong> keep your CGPA good (9+)</strong>. Keep gaining experience in your field of interest, either through internships, or through independent open-source projects of your own. Also, prior research projects are really a big boost to your profile, especially if you publish your work as a research paper.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Don't be hesitant about applying for an opportunity thinking you might not be <strong>\"good enough\"</strong>, you never know, you might be a perfect fit for the role! So, always apply to all the opportunities that interest you.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i><strong>PS: </strong>If you want to apply to NTU for research work, there is another way to go about it as well – through the <strong>“NTU India Connect programme”.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<h2><i><strong>Gurharpartap Singh Dhaliwal, COE, Class of 2023, shares his internship experience at Twitter, Inc., as a Software Engineering Intern.&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>I was preparing for and aggressively seeking SDE internships in 2021 so that I could gain an exposure to the corporate world right from undergraduate level. Twitter visited DTU campus in September 2021. It was open for four branches (CO, IT, SE, MCE). There were no CGPA requirements. I am glad that I was able to experience this internship and learn so much at Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Selection Process:</strong></h3><p>As part of the selection process, there were four rounds, each of which was rigorous and involved many factors. As we progressed through each round, all of our skills were tested in depth.</p><p><strong>Round 1 - </strong>2 Medium-Hard coding Questions to be solved on hackerrank within 60-75 minutes.</p><p><i>This was followed by 3 consecutive interviews. Each interview was 1-hour long.</i></p><p><strong>Round 2-&nbsp; </strong>2 Medium-Hard DSA questions were asked.</p><p><strong>Round 3- </strong>This was a round dedicated to the core subjects of computer science and focussed on evaluating candidates in this domain.</p><p><strong>Round 4- </strong>This round focussed on past projects, internships and cultural fit.</p><p><i>After a complex selection process consisting of the online assessment round and the multiple thorough interviews, six DTU students were chosen for the internship program.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Beginning with the Internship at Twitter, Inc.</strong></h3><p>For the internship, we had the option to either do it virtually or offline. I chose the latter and relocated to Bangalore. I have to admit that trying to find housing was a bit of a challenge and could make for quite an interesting story on its own! My internship started on 8th of May, and the journey from there on was nothing short of wonderful!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3><p>I worked at Twitter as a member of the Global Participation team. I had to collaborate with another intern (from DTU) on a project. The project we were responsible for required a blend of backend and machine learning knowledge.</p><ul><li>The project was to create an <strong>interest taxonomy to power Twitter topic picker</strong> using different data sources (I cannot provide exact details of the project due to the company's privacy policy) Two mentors were assigned to us who guided us and helped us with the project.</li></ul><p>The project was divided into 4 parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Visualisation</strong>- Representing the final result</li><li><strong>Data Filtration</strong> - Removing anomalies in the data</li><li><strong>Data Migration</strong>- Moving data to cloud</li><li><strong>Data Extraction</strong>- Extracting relevant data from different data sources</li></ul><p>These tasks were done async. We were free to use the tech stack of our choice. The biggest issue was managing the vast volume of data. But in the end, we were able to significantly reduce the amount of data and concluded our internship by providing a solid solution!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Meetings</strong></h3><p>Every Tuesday and Thursday, we would meet our mentors to discuss the work accomplished during the previous stretch and to set goals for the upcoming week. These meets often included brainstorming sessions where ideas for effective yet straightforward solutions to problems were shared.</p><p>We spoke with ML engineers, who assisted us in getting started and offered their ideas. Slack was the main chat application used. We had slack channels for basically everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fun Events</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vyy7DI7IvTx8AivBM6js11_K6gUp-3LQkqsbfXbT4pYHYySQUpqK1Lq06SFrVw7B06lcrVyL0lPlKwVPJqawvwLQZViuPgBp38yp0LLFryMaKSyyiuoFcLoHSU_0POiJGjAUd2j11HNwLHrIMsh9eBia6IDXWEnItyonqXiP1epgzOgGnKA\"></figure><p>There were many memorable events that I enjoyed while we were at work. We played games like Pictionary and Treasure Hunt wherein we received rewards too. For the virtual interns, various fun online events were organised. We regularly dined as a team. Field trips were also conducted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>At the end of this wonderful journey</strong></h3><p>Our internship ended on 29th July. The whole process went really smoothly. I learned how businesses operate and how real tasks are completed.&nbsp;</p><p>The project we worked on can enhance the Home Time Line's User Active Minutes. It will also improve Tweet Click rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Advice For Juniors:</strong></h3><p><i>As you prepare for your journey, there are a few things I would recommend to you:</i></p><ol><li>Participate in a competitive programming contest.</li><li>In-depth study of core subjects should be done.</li><li>Communication skills are essential during the interview.</li><li>Try to participate in team projects and have some open source contributions on your resume. It is extremely valuable.</li></ol><p><i>During your internship, do pay attention to the following points:&nbsp;</i></p><ol><li>Document everything you do as much as possible.</li><li>Establish appropriate goals and strive to achieve them.</li><li>Seek assistance rather than remaining stuck.</li><li>Most importantly, communicate your progress to your mentor and manager.</li><li>Take initiative in team tech discussions, fun sessions, and so on.</li></ol>",

    "slug": "carnegie-mellon-university-internship-experience-901",
    "body": "<p>Among the many coveted research internships at foreign universities, the Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS) programme offered by Carnegie Mellon University stands out as one of the most competitive internships in the field of Robotics. Having been selected for the DAAD-WISE and the MITACS GRI programmes as well, I had to choose between these two and the RISS internship programme. Since I was truly interested in research in robotics, I chose the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University due to its competitive nature and the extensive research opportunities it offers in this field. I spent my summer of 2022 immersing myself into comprehensive research and development and all in all, it was a challenging yet wonderfully amazing experience!</p><p><strong>The Application Process</strong></p><p>For RISS, the application usually begins around the 15th of November. There are certain documents that one needs to submit. You are required to submit a resume or curriculum vitae(CV), statement of purpose, two letters of recommendation from faculty advisors or instructors, and unofficial transcripts from your entire undergraduate period. The statement of purpose that you need to submit is similar to your master's application and it is a two-page essay where you need to tell them—“why you want this internship”,&nbsp; “what exactly you would do during this internship”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After you submit your application, it goes through the initial process of shortlisting in the Robotics Institute at CMU. They then pick you up according to your profile and then forward your profile to two or three professors, with whom your profile would be compatible for the research internship. These professors then evaluate your profile to decide if they’d want to proceed with your application for the next step i.e. the interviews! You are invited for an interview with the professor if your application makes it through the previous steps of evaluation.</p><p>After the interview, if the professor finds your profile suitable and is satisfied with your performance in the interview, they offer to fund you for the two-months internship in the US. This is the complete process of making it through the entire application process and finally getting selected!&nbsp;</p><p>An important factor to consider is to make sure your application stands out! A key part of my application was UGV-DTU (Unmanned Ground Vehicle-DTU)!&nbsp; I’ve been working with the UGV-DTU team since my first year. The major benefit this provided me was the connection I formed with the professors. This helped me in getting a really strong letter of recommendation. I would say that in these kinds of internships, which are basically academia based, the LoR you submit matters a lot. The LoR I had received mentioned all the work I had accomplished accounting for my qualities and skills. Apart from this, I got research experience working within this team as I worked on many robotics-related projects. My area of interest was specifically in robotics perception (Machine learning, Computer Vision, etc.) and while I was in UGV, our works and discussions were related to robotics perception and other associated areas, which led me to secure an internship at IIIT Hyderabad. So, this was another major factor which was initiated by UGV and something that added substance to my profile. In addition to this, I also worked in the Samsung Research Lab at DTU for a few months and published a research paper related to my field. Hence, all of this in combination was a substantial addition to my profile.</p><p><i><strong>\"There will be obstacles. There will be doubters. There will be mistakes. But with hard work, there are no limits.\" - Michael Phelps.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>I did face some challenges while applying for this internship and all throughout my internship as well. Here are some suggestions I’d want to share:</p><p>&nbsp;- People there are very hardworking. They work overnight, and sometimes not even go back home. You will need to adapt yourself to this fast-paced, diligent and industrious environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- Once you are selected, I’d suggest you have a proper plan laid out. They’d asked me to provide them a weekly plan chart for the two months of my working schedule over there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- You need to find a research problem way ahead of time. It’s not like you first get selected and you decide your research field later on. You should initially have a basic research problem that you’d want to work on in mind. This would make it easier for you to write the two-page essay.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- The motivation letter that you are required to submit needs to be on point — you should clearly state your intentions and all what you’d want to do there as a research intern.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- The very first challenge was to receive a good letter of recommendation. As I said, letters of recommendation play an extremely important part. So to get selected for these kinds of&nbsp; internships, you need to have a very good letter of recommendation, either from very good professors or the content in the letters should be very strong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>During the Internship - It was simply great at CMU!</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E56yq7P_pPO_5qKBYQ51gQLuQu9NM1vgGt3nYeoxoHCQb2wX3vDRWeXqSs3OTT0vJRjYLY6R3NkSgC5N2P2tFyFDNuoc4A6NYF195T_3mZnBqvwafe9-tcJJSar0Pn5omEq2gJvVjDb7IneqvyNNJG0iV1X1eFEqigJnKSFHplJz3b2qgWL56EFO0A\"></figure><p>Just in two months in the USA, I found myself working 10-12 hours a day which was utterly exhausting. I had to complete my research in two months, which ideally people do in six or seven months. So, it was all very fast-paced.&nbsp; Despite this, there were a lot of other things that I did. I visited many places — travelling to New York was a really fun experience!</p><p>Unlike most research internships, where there is a professor or a PhD student working on a project and you are working along with them on their work, in the RISS internship you need to&nbsp; start your own project. You need to complete the research and publish a paper on it in which you're the first author of that paper. This might all seem extremely difficult but the Robotics Institute is so collaborative and supportive that it not only makes your journey much easier but also enriches your entire experience. You can approach anyone over there – any PhD, any Postdoctoral researcher, even any scientist or professor from another lab to solve your queries or suggest to you some other PhD student who can work with you or who’d be interested to work with you.</p><p>I remember I too had some problems initially— I was struggling to get a research idea. So, I talked to some people over there regarding it which helped me out to a great extent. Even during my entire research, many other PhD and Master’s students working in my lab helped me a lot. Apart from this, I even enjoyed the various other activities in the lab. We had&nbsp; weekly meetings and we had monthly barbecue sessions! So, the connectivity and the collaborations were excellent.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7Qv720k01D7_QNiTGs3jPi3boP2-ORIG_Co9k8ME0TBSoSHkxkHlpixFJsL6khwgPRO49gtGxA-I92FIcQFVoYDW503MioYae8wTzQq-QfKZp_vzcKTK_F52WltsnlmVVjxl6sltasrqbXL9XyMAiru3Zugg1fQRDuclJRJMypvAGYctXNY_hbthTA\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GzRhT5fB9BUCgt9ilMLU5fGkEqBFVcAWrvHs23-n7wv6CkBXb7R7lsAxJqTrB42V9Bjz5TD4yDsY2RwKf2PnWHIV4vCrFt5CU1XMEmJB0OrFc-I2Z1i-pquSQqmPdrQogmA2Mjx0RAsTg98A1gc3e2V2VfQKRgAqi3GoW_hqBu1u-QkVSEJVxX_2HQ\"></figure><p><strong>The Project:</strong></p><p><i><strong>AirLoc: Object-based Indoor Relocalization</strong></i></p><p>Indoor relocalization is vital for both robotic tasks such as autonomous exploration and civil applications such as navigation with a cell phone in a shopping mall. Some previous approaches adopt geometrical information or local textures to carry out indoor relocalization, but they are often not robust enough to hierarchical relocalization, namely a relocalization having different hierarchies such as building level, room level and object level. Inspired by the fact that humans often remember places by recognizing unique landmarks, we resort to objects, which are more informative than geometry elements for indoor relocalization. In this context, we propose a novel object-based indoor relocalization approach, dubbed AirLoc. To overcome the critical challenges including object reidentification and remembering object relationships, we extract object-wise appearance embedding and pixel-wise geometrical relationship. These objects are linked to rooms and further to buildings for a hierarchical scene representation. This results in a robust, accurate, and portable indoor relocalization system. AirLoc performs well for room-level relocalization and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12% in PR-AUC and 8% in accuracy. It is robust to severe occlusion, perceptual aliasing, viewpoint shift, deformation, and scale transformation as well. To the best of my knowledge, AirLoc is one of the first object-based hierarchical indoor relocalization approaches.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f-Bo0E0umsH_zOzROAS1xJfXKilO7keJsA3Xr1fxCHfdo25zt-wZ3RjazKUmbel6kBtNJffvJoTWGxcxI0e70i5WLzV8nTe0zzuEt0RSAqI5tLQWztv7YpsNOX6Cvpw2uNGBiOXJxvBfXFL5wziQ6ecs2CReRVajrgHv5d2E8Ntj_eV_4srZ-Bqg9g\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Takeaways from my Internship:</strong></p><p>I initially wanted to do a PhD in robotics but during my internship as I interacted with many professors, some PhD and postdoctoral fellows and even some MBA students, I experienced the research environment in depth. I ended up realising that I should pursue a Masters in Robotics initially and then decide whether I am best fit for a PhD program or not. I also realised that the work environment in the US is way&nbsp; better than in India. So I finally decided to go to the US for my Masters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some advice for the juniors:</strong></p><p>Having a publication specific to robotics in an internationally renowned journal is a worthy addition. I’d suggest you contact a professor or a PhD fellow under whom you can work for publishing a research paper. This is the best way to gain initial experience at conducting research and writing a research paper. This way you get to learn all about the process of writing and publishing your own research paper and how exactly things work!</p><p>For your Github Profile:<i> </i>For RISS,<i> </i>they just look into robotics-related projects or&nbsp; some machine learning projects as well. All they want is something related to robotics.<i> </i>If you consider Mitacs or DAAD-WISE, they don't want you to be very&nbsp; proficient in robotics. Any slightly related project which is nicely documented, is neat and clean, and intelligible to anyone can be a great addition for your Mitacs or DAAD -WISE application.</p><p>RISS, specifically, is a very competitive research internship. So, you need to have some prior&nbsp; research experience as well. If somebody is in first or second&nbsp; year, the main thing that they need to&nbsp; do is to apply for some Indian robotics labs to get some research experience. After that&nbsp; they should try to form some good connections with the professor so that they can write letters of recommendation to them. And lastly, they need to work on their resume! Things like your skills and a good Github profile also matter a lot.&nbsp;</p>",

There were two technical rounds and an HR round—a whole-day process where I was judged based on my technical knowledge and coding skills that included <strong>DSA, DBMS, OOPs, and COA.</strong> Even though the internship was virtual due to COVID-19, <i>my experience was immensely thrilling!</i></p><p><strong>DURING THE INTERNSHIP - </strong><i><strong>Workshops, Meetings, Projects, Interactions &amp; much more!</strong></i></p><p>My internship at Wells Fargo began on 30th of May 2022 and lasted two months. Our eight weeks at the company was divided such that after each week or two, our progress would be evaluated by our mentors. The first week was mainly about us getting used to working as a group and learning how to be productive and efficient. We were given multiple problem statements and had to choose the one we felt would bring out the best of us. Each statement was unique, requiring us to think in all possible directions.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Before starting off with my internship, I was apprehensive since it was my first time entering the corporate culture, but thanks to Wells Fargo, it was smooth sailing. During the internship, there were weekly workshops and seminars on how one should tackle moral and social problems in the corporate world.&nbsp; This made the overall journey of my internship even more interesting and exhilarating!</p></blockquote><p>Our team consisted of twelve interns who were managed by two mentors. Meetings with our mentors were held every alternate day to discuss their views and suggestions on the problem statement. Given the problem statement, we divided the twelve member team into three teams for <strong>UI/UX, Backend and Machine Learning</strong> respectively. I got to work in the ML team, where I explored various ML concepts and libraries such as <strong>NLP, NLTK, Spacy, BERT, and Roberta</strong> to tackle our problem statement. We used Google Colab to keep up to date with each other’s contributions to the project.</p><blockquote><p>I opted for ML because I was familiar with the topic, as I had done multiple ML courses online. I had also done some ML projects previously such as ‘Stock price prediction using linear regression model’ and ‘Movie recommendation system using neural networks and backpropagation’ and a few more.</p></blockquote><p>The frontend team focused on designing the appropriate web pages and connecting firebase authentication to react. The backend team made the necessary routes and connection with the database and any other required data. The tasks included storage of user details, and managing flow of data with the GUI. The Machine Learning Team, which I was a part of, pre-processed the data, developed the various models to test their efficiency on the dataset.&nbsp;</p><p><i>After each team completed their work, each module was integrated with each other followed by testing and deployment if felt needed.</i></p><p><i><strong>My Ever-so-exciting Eight Weeks at Wells Fargo:</strong></i></p><p>Since the workflow of the internship was preplanned, the pace of the project went smoothly due to the preparation. During the eight weeks, week-1 was for assessing the problem statement, week-2 was given for documentation followed by week-3 and 4 when the implementation took place. After a month we had our first demo with the higher officials and the following two weeks were given to optimize and improve our work. Week-7 had our final presentation where we had to explain the problem statement and pitch in our solution to the problem and how it is beneficial to the company. The final week was our assessment week, both as a group and as individuals where we had to list our contribution to the project.</p><p>There were no fixed working hours. We did not have to login at 9 am and log out at 5 pm. We held daily meets regarding our flow of work in the morning, setting tasks for the day and discussing what we did the previous day. At the end of the day, we would meet virtually, overseeing each other’s works and ensuring that the task set for that day is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Overall, being an intern at Wells Fargo has been a huge learning experience for me – not only gaining the knowledge but also implementing it in such a friendly and helpful environment was enriching as an intern.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Some Advice for Juniors:</strong></p><p><strong>1. CGPA is of the utmost importance</strong> as it is the first criteria on which a candidate is judged whether he is allowed to sit for the Online Assessment/Coding round or not. It’s also <strong>used as a tiebreaker</strong> for interviews, and thus <i>maintaining a good CGPA is a must.</i></p><p>2. For technical interviews and assessments, having <strong>good knowledge of DSA</strong> is necessary to clear the round.</p><p>3.<strong> Be confident with your resume</strong> and know the ins and outs of all your projects. You shouldn’t be caught off guard with something that's on your resume.</p>",

It was my first opportunity to step into a new world and explore how the corporate world works. I was extremely excited to embark on this journey. Moreover, being the first student from my branch to get an opportunity to work with Expedia Group, I was pumped up to give my best, but was equally jittery about how things would unfold.</p><p><strong>The Preparation:</strong></p><p>During my initial years in college, I took my time to explore all possible avenues and choose the best fit for me. Setting foot into the tech industry did not seem easy at first considering the immense competition. However, for me, coding was not just a gateway to some high-paying tech job. It has always been more about the learning, the mental development it brings along, and the joy of solving problems and learning something new. Practice is what makes you perfect, especially in competitive programming. So I scheduled my DSA practice sessions and followed it religiously throughout my coding journey.</p><p><strong>Bagging the Internship &amp; </strong><i><strong>the</strong></i><strong> </strong><i><strong>Journey thereon:</strong></i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DrFTHLwzrqjYZAtDoznqCz-q4UyujJ73C1iqfGZ4gSd94WdH05We62MzKcC4ed29aXnVSTHK04X2xlzSJKTrf0JOO8C6OC4pu5ebBHOvDcDCo1EkEFR1qMcZmc3-6JGfSfEw7ofrIw06tYw6HIFjHcTgAckR5iAyyl-XSNLRXBOPlx_01kCP69uCVw\"></figure><p>During the Intern-hiring season on our campus, I got the opportunity to apply for Expedia Group.

    "body": "<p><i>Disha Malik, Chemical Engineering, Class of 2023, shares her internship experience as a DAAD WISE Scholar 2022 at the Technical University of Munich, Germany</i></p><p>I got an amazing opportunity to explore research in an international laboratory during my three-month internship at<strong> TU Munich, Germany</strong>. It was a phenomenal experience- the learning, the travelling, and the experiences were surreal. I got to know about these highly competitive research internships during the lockdown and started building my profile by doing various internships, such as at IIT Bombay, DRDO, and Aditya Birla Chemicals (Thailand). I worked hard to maintain my CGPA and wrote research papers along with other extracurriculars. It wasn’t always easy and didn’t happen overnight- it was a slow and tedious process, but I was determined to land the coveted foreign internships. I wanted to explore academia in another country, and DAAD was truly worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BEFORE THE INTERNSHIP:</strong></p><p>When the application process was near, I was hoping to get into MITACS (as I gathered positive responses from 5/7 professors I had applied under), and because DAAD seemed too ambitious a goal, given that it was awarded to a few in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>However, things didn't go according to my plan, as life rarely does. I was dejected when I faced a stream of rejections. I began to question how better I could have built my profile. I began to doubt myself, and those sneaky little insecurities that I feared started crawling in again. I got rejected from multiple on-campus internships as well as from MITACS. My hopes were dashed again when even after getting a positive reply from multiple professors that I had applied under but got rejected. I had lost all hopes of bagging an internship, and DAAD had delayed the results that year.&nbsp;</p><p>And then, out of the blue, I received the news that the results were about to be declared in the evening. Hit by nervous jitters, I anxiously checked and rechecked my phone as I hung onto the very last shred of hope I had. I felt that the chances of me getting selected at that point were very bleak. And then, the anticipated notification finally popped up on my phone at around 2 PM. I had no idea that a single email would change the course of my life so spectacularly. I was elated and overjoyed that all the hard work- the internships, exams, and projects had truly helped me achieve this incredible opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>The next few weeks went by in a blur, I couldn’t even tell anyone about it as it wasn’t allowed until the official formalities were complete. We now worked to complete the tedious<strong> Schengen Visa</strong> process, booking tickets and endless searching for accommodation in Munich. By the time I told everyone, the feeling had already sunk in.&nbsp;</p><p>The DAAD WISE internship was a dream come true. I was very apprehensive when I was applying for it given the rigorous process and the fierce competition along with the low acceptance rate. But in the end, I was glad I took a chance to apply because this opportunity has given me the best exposure that I could have possibly asked for at an undergraduate level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE APPLICATION PROCESS :</strong></p><p>DAAD-WISE gives you funding to avail of an internship opportunity to pursue research in a German public-funded institute during your undergraduate years. To apply, you must be in your<strong> pre-final year</strong> (in a 4-year degree program).</p><p>Usually, international internships are competitive, and to outshine, one needs to have a balanced profile. Having a high CGPA (usually an aggregate above 9.2 or 9.3 is required), research projects or internships preferably at IITs, or industrial experience, as well as technical skills such as programming, and data analysis could add a silver lining to your resume.</p><p>The basic processes of the application include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Drafting the perfect email</li><li>Finding your host professor</li><li>Applying on the scholarship portal</li><li>Assembling your documents</li><li>Await the results now and if selected, start the visa application process.</li></ol><p>The first step is to compose the email that you are going to send across to all professors. In the beginning, you can begin with your introduction, your CGPA, followed by your research experience. You can then mention your interest in the professor’s work and why you are the right fit for them. <strong>Do mention that you do not expect to get paid in their lab.</strong> Because applying for a DAAD scholarship is the next step which would eventually look after your funding requirements. Finally, attach links to your Curriculum Vitae (CV) and transcripts. Getting a positive reply is both a stroke of luck and an abundance of dedication. Do not feel disheartened if you do not receive a reply within the first few days. Keep following up with the professors after a week or two.</p><p><strong>Finding a German Host Professor:</strong></p><p>This usually is a time taking process. I spent nearly 2-3 entire weeks doing just this. Your patience will be put to the test because cold emailing might be intimidating. You can search for <strong>TU9 universities</strong> and the chairs in which you are interested. Then for each of those universities, you can look through all the professors in the designated labs and see who is doing work that you like the most and aligns with your previous research experience. You can even <strong>CC your emails to the PhD students for better chances.</strong></p><p><strong>To apply for the DAAD Scholarship:</strong></p><p>After the affirmative email, one is supposed to apply on the DAAD scholarship portal along with all the required documents. You are required to fill out an online application form which would ask for your basic details. Your letters of recommendation, letter of motivation, project proposal, invitation letter from the German host, and a few NOCs from your Indian university are required to be submitted along with the application form. Try to maintain a good rapport with your mentors so that you can contact them for your LORs. Try to reach out to those professors/mentors only under whom you have done any courses or projects. The LOR should express a good relationship between you and them along with your aptitude for research. You and your German host could potentially discuss the project proposal before you come up with your own. The printed summary must be sent to the DAAD Delhi office after all the required documents and the application form have been submitted. <strong>The result is usually out in the month of February or the beginning of March.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>THE PROJECT :</strong></p><p>During my internship, I conducted research on<strong> 'X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis of 3D transition metals' at TU München.</strong></p><p>I worked on special equipment which was only present at the TU Munich laboratory and had to critically analyse, inspect, research, and study every element. I conducted my research with the help of state-of-the-art methods and lab-based XAS instrumentations for collecting the XAFS spectra of transition metal catalysts. The material synthesis and the associated results have diverse applications in the fields of catalysis, nanomaterials, and chemistry in general.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5mkP14Ks2Ll-X5MjqAC5SNXZlAPFICXY55fQKQJg1Osx2NVekQBHLxW-avyALzo8wMXHmRL_M9_6EaI9gNc7hQ23B2rPNHBAJgSqYTMd47YRgnArhbgvKdEtvdfYwvCR2gXQEEmtbKmjCW2H2BR1xSL9OryAPf7WJi4-hi2WDgGghVpB6PoHW1XJXA\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/klfJtSdu5KjSQsk8YaI42UeBKQR54bcsOAuieVTsnrY_yLH2Xx4HMeMTvnVJB2Mb9aGhaMKgj5kLHZZbS5FywVSJigfNHyyEV8EvlOUZy0o-8xmUWoWq8eAe4gd1RidzNGyxPUWD03Ybw0jFoyZBGHeW_hoWNSURvs5H9BBlBGVmjgCb7cUi9kB7og\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MY EXPERIENCE:</strong></p><p>Despite popular belief, even after landing my internship, in the beginning, it was not all sunshine and roses. I faced certain difficulties when I started my journey. When I landed, I was more than overwhelmed to be a part of the Bavarian streets.</p><p>However, I struggled to find accommodation in Munich very much. Looking for one that would suit me for the next three long months was a difficult task, I had to also battle the waves of homesickness that kept creeping in. It was harder to adjust at first, to become accustomed to a way of living differently than what I was used to. But, I decided to pull up my socks to make the most of my experience, and then there was no looking back. But I had no idea that a rollercoaster ride was waiting ahead of me- one that would actually make life like sunshine and roses. I travelled to the most beautiful places on the planet that I could have never imagined. I travelled across most parts of Italy (Rome, Venice, Florence, Pisa, Milan), Vatican City, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, and the most beautiful and memorable experience of all time, Paris!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NPLrJV51B4rjmbpXX5W-Tl4SwMmTZpmhXsv3MVzvfIpn1-VWz96W3mYH-NpQSfLQy3gbmNUnd1-ilc5TkV2hcEc-8fCP5uPyxSSQxBfzv-jkRSEHjQUoYmPvLm_qW6t9Lme9M_mOc8lMpDMPvFM87jiNVFtLlE0Yej5wvS_lYCRdaGNCBFHWsS54nA\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZW9_G1395g71dI1m8qoRQMSk18c92pfyvHoSwHvf006xqSUhXe5AFu9VNMZPtCr2qVRhcvyow2cUMic6n0aiE6BKnAABryZm3S5bfQvBYuKcxcpE25ARgE-gkPnYrZPGGgbjGJWcJ_ZQ0JrZL6dVohbMNNxJsHigcLIgkFXe-ETNlfM2GDLNKxBNVg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Managing the project and lab work, placement preparation, pulling off hectic trips, cooking for the first time, and carrying out daily chores was a task to pull off.

Try establishing a connection between the professor's work, your skill set, and what you are willing to contribute.</li><li>The best time to send emails is between 9 and 10 am on weekdays (European Time). The chances of your email getting noticed are the maximum when the professors are usually checking their mailboxes with a cup of coffee!</li><li>Look for lodging well in advance. Finding student housing can be quite tough in some cities, such as Berlin and Munich.</li><li>Take this opportunity to travel through other European countries. It will teach you to be independent and trust yourself even more.</li></ul><p>Even though adapting to working in an international workspace is sometimes tough. You must always be up-forward and honest with your professors about your work, and it is always difficult to get into good books as an international student. It was amazing to explore newer ways of academic research and learning that I got to work on my project.</p><p>I would highly encourage all eligible candidates to apply, as I count this as an excellent opportunity, especially for women in STEM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>You’re one of India’s top entrepreneurs. How did you end up becoming an entrepreneur?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Back in 1982, there was no concept of entrepreneurship. Within six months of working at Tata Motors, Bihar, I realised I was not an excellent mechanical engineer. Along with my roommate, I decided to study for the CAT and eventually landed at IIM Calcutta. Working in small entrepreneurial companies inflicts confidence in us to take a giant leap, so I joined HCL. Short answer, I was an accidental entrepreneur. And entrepreneurship is like an addiction. My first venture was IT&amp;T in 1990. Since then, there has been no turning back.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What should aspiring entrepreneurs aim for to secure their success?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Entrepreneurship is tough. 9 out of 10 startups don’t work out. The best analogy is a lottery. If you’re passionate or foolish to bet on a lottery, you should bet on something where the win is huge. If you want to pursue entrepreneurship, financially speaking, the expectations have to be high. In practice, this means going for a large sector. <i>Roti, kapda, makaan, </i>education, entertainment, and healthcare are all essential large sectors. It is as challenging as starting a BigBasket, but you will win with a minimal outcome. Go for big pain points, the must-haves and not the good-haves, to maximise your prospects.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What is the secret formula behind choosing the winning bets like BigBasket and Blue Stone, the idea or the person behind the idea?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There is no secret formula; it is a lottery game to place many bets. The player who made the winning shot determines the game, not the proportion of opportunities that got converted. I envision entering a brand-new industry with no precedents, something fresh in a greenfield with a blue-ocean approach. Choose something novel or with significant pain points, and disrupt it in a way no one else can.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>You have a very successful career and four successful entrepreneurship experiences. What were some of your challenges with raising money, scaling, and growing across many countries?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There were a massive number of challenges. The lack of talent and expertise was a challenge to being a pioneer in a greenfield industry within the sphere of consumer-based businesses. Raising capital was a big challenge in convincing venture capitalists to invest. People seek the security and comfort of a well-paying job, so structuring a core team in a fragile setup of a new business was a tough nut to crack. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>How does a person develop a risk appetite? How does one decide between having a job or having a startup?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>If you incessantly think and keep your antenna up, a fraction of this attitude will come on its own. It took me two years to start my first venture. Because of my educational background, I knew I could find a job, even if not the best or highest-paying. Your ideas will start to germinate, which entails you taking risks. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you have any messages or advice for the students of DTU?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Today, the number of opportunities in India makes much more sense to maximise opportunities than to minimise risks. You would regret more if you missed opportunities when trying to play safe. One of the biggest challenges is that people take the well-trodden path. Ensure that you play with the possibilities proffered today.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>You have been in the energy industry for the past three decades and have witnessed the technological advancements that have taken place. How do you view India’s progression concerning sustainability?</strong></p><p>The country has enormous solar and wind potential; we have harnessed only a fraction of that to date. All sustainable energy sources require storage systems; hence, battery energy storage solutions are being explored, and a system with a capacity of 1000MW has already been engineered. A tender has been issued by Solar Energy Corporation of India for the implementation of the same. We also have a very ambitious green hydrogen energy program, wherein production figures of 5 million tonnes of hydrogen are anticipated. To produce 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, 8GW of electrolyzers would have to be in place, adding to the country's electricity demands. With the present technology, we can produce 15-20GW of electrolyzers, and this figure has to be ramped up going forward.</p><p><strong>You have recently assumed the position of CMD of POSOCO. What are some of the changes that you wish to bring about?</strong></p><p>My job now is to ensure that the next generation of system engineers has a very robust grid, which would ensure that their problems are minimal. That process begins with tweaking the standards. Standards for wind and solar energy storage equipment are of utmost importance. System behavior in faulty situations should be monitored, and the results obtained should be used to set the standards. We cannot afford to lose an entire energy processing system due to faulty or poor-grade equipment. Although standards are internationally agreed upon and are not in our direct control, we must advocate for airtight standards.</p><p><strong>Your speech discussed ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid.’ What are the challenges we are faced with in accomplishing this initiative?</strong></p><p>The major problem we face is getting an agreement from the bordering countries. There has been a conversation with the Sri Lankan government regarding this, where initial research pointed towards an underwater sea cable. However, further research has shown that an overhead line in places like Rameshwaram is possible as the depth is not much in those areas. We’ve been trying to reach a consensus, but the prime dilemma is who puts up the money for the cross-border line. Considering both countries' long-term welfare, India has considered financing it through grants. Cross-border communication between the system operators in real-time must be maintained through standard procedures.</p><p><strong>Predicting electrical load requirements and accurately calculating the same would prove to be much better than a sustainable source. What is your take on this?</strong></p><p>Load forecasting is increasingly becoming challenging with increased variable factors and frequent out-of-pattern load requirements. What we mean by ‘load’ as system operators is the load on the transmission system. If rooftop solar is implemented at the transmission level, the load on transmission effectively gets reduced. Minimizing errors in the load forecast is tricky as there are uncertain variables like weather, which also contribute to the load demand. A prediction for the day ahead can be made with an error of 3-4%, and subsequently, intraday statistical adjustments can be made according to usage patterns. A higher percentage of error would require a larger reserve as overhead.</p>",

We had a really good faculty and I believe, the faculty of DTU is excellent even now. DCE was a brand name and continues to sustain its prominence. There certainly are many differences as the institute has evolved with time. The number of students being admitted in the university has radically increased and DTU has advanced in terms of the facilities it provides. The campus area is vast with excellent sports facilities and well-equipped labs. In addition, now there are more female students which is a great improvement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does one overcome the challenges while promoting teamwork in an organization?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Challenges always exist. Leadership that cultivates a sense of ownership amongst its workers is extremely important. An organization has different kinds of people.

Listening to the ideas of others, no matter how contradictory it is, and not being close-minded will enrich your thought process. Secondly, proper analysis is important. Analyze every possibility.

It is selfish if it is right only for you, and in the long run, society, people, and collaborations are more important.</p><p><strong>The youth today often misinterpret our religious scriptures. How should we tell them about what they actually advocate?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I believe, once the person reads these scriptures, they will form pertinent understanding. These scriptures have a lot of scientific principles which we can adopt even today. For example, the concepts of ‘Karma’ and ‘Rebirth’, ‘Sukta’ and ‘Nasadiya Sukta’ and all the other concepts in our scriptures incorporate most scientific and psychological principles. We need to propagate this idea to the youth that these scriptures can help them throughout their life.</p><p><strong>Could you reiterate the importance of teamwork in an organization? Do you think there are any challenges faced while promoting this kind of an environment?</strong></p><p>Challenges always exist. Leadership that cultivates the sense of ownership amongst its workers is extremely important. An organization has different kinds of people and if the one who possesses the position of leadership is able to create the concept of ownership and likewise every member understands this viewpoint, then they all start working together.

    "body": "<p><strong>What is the importance of teamwork in any organization? How do we decide the right people for our goals?</strong></p><p>What is the complete form of a team? Together, we achieve more. Organizations win or lose because they have the right people in the right place. The team has one coach and a captain, and they're different. The captain commands others, and the coach gives liberty and space to grow. Room to succeed means you've got a vision, and the coach brings that synergy to the team so that everybody contributes 120 percent. So, every organization should have these two.</p><p><strong>How does one establish a sense of ownership over his vision or idea?</strong></p><p>I believe in 'keeping it simple'. Think of a mother who conceives a baby; she starts caring for the coming baby from the first day. Then finally, a day will come when it will start delivering the results to you. A dream is like a tree. You've to nurture it and take care of it at every step. Once your plan yields results, keep moving forward with new ideas. Narayan Murthy is one of the best instances of this. You are all students right now, you'll be in a different stage of life in a few years; your previous step is now in the past and no longer affects you. Life is constantly evolving.</p><p><strong>Can you guide us on how to keep ourselves refocussing on our dream?</strong></p><p>I'll quote Dr. Kalam, 'A dream is something that does not allow you to sleep.' You will find a way out if you are passionate about your dream. I feel that students are mature enough to recognise what knowledge is beneficial to them. If you've decided on a single goal, make a strategy for achieving it and by when you'll accomplish it. Begin keeping track of your everyday progress toward your goal. You'll feel content once you start completing trivial goals, and that confidence will lead you to your bigger ambitions one day.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>Growing up is a tedious process. You start to realize that the legends of your childhood are not mythical after all. Before you know it, you're thrown into the ocean to battle huge waves that were, only a few years ago, \"things children need not worry about,\" with little idea of what you're doing. Any social barrier can seem insurmountable in a time like this, no matter how seemingly random and irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p>As a child, most of us are taught by everyone around us that we can achieve anything we want if we just work hard enough. And so we believe it. We spend years preparing for a vision, gearing up for a goal that over 2 lakh other peers have as well. Some of us don't make it. Some of us do. However, no one teaches us about the external factors that affect our success after this first checkpoint and how sometimes others' opinions and prejudices will precede our efforts and capabilities.</p><p>Being a queer undergraduate in STEM comes with challenges and under-representation. A queer representation of less than a percent within a class and not getting the platform to make queers aware of their rights and create safe spaces within institutions results in biases that are questioned at every point. While heteronormal people in STEM have been rooted in a deep sense of being intelligent, at the same time, they lack the empathy needed to create a space for people with various gender identities. STEM for queers requires role models and queers in positions of decision-making where policies are strategized. It took me a while to understand and express myself as a queer (non-binary) individual within this academic setup. I have been questioned and discriminated against by people at positions and even the faculties.&nbsp;</p><p>As a woman in STEM, sure, I felt the judgement and dismissal all too well. The hushed whispers about diversity hiring as the antithesis of merit, snatching jobs from boys in a college that had a gender ratio of 87% skewed in their favor, always seemed to forget every diligent woman working twice as hard to earn the same amount of recognition, if she was lucky, as her male counterparts did. The devaluation of women's work and the evident systematic roadblocks that make a career in any field, especially STEM, challenging for women have reinforced the gendered division and perception of labor. This has left women in a vulnerable state in an already imbalanced society where men, the economy, and the country prosper at their expense. The probability of success decreases exponentially on a tilted stage where the rules were never made to be fair in the first place.</p><p>When it comes to STEM being accepting enough, it lacks vision and equality. Expression comes with a generous sprinkle of negative experiences resulting from a predominantly heteronormative and patriarchal society. The silences around identities and sexualities within the STEM spaces result in a less sensitized environment. This silence needs to be filled so that people have the sensitization to their pronouns and gender expression.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Going out on a picnic, the last thing on Amanda’s mind was the thought of her 2nd-grade friend turned enemy Cassandra, who she hadn’t seen since 8th grade. A flurry of emotions ranging from <i>anger</i>, which was suppressed for many years all the way to <i>regret</i>, to have lost someone who meant the world to them dawned on her. While both were at the same park, only Amanda was aware of Cassandra’s presence. As she saw Cassandra pass by the park's gate, she almost reflexively started sauntering her way to the other end of the park, so as not to arouse any suspicion.&nbsp;</p><p>The park was a peculiar labyrinth in itself, having the byzantine characteristic of making your way out through the other end practically impossible without covering the entire park once. Scared of the idea of encountering her friend, Amanda kept trying to find the most evasive paths<i>, </i>howsoever circuitous that route turned out to be. What followed is a half-hour anxiety-fueled game of cat and mouse, where the cat wasn’t even aware of the mouse’s presence. Throughout this comical situation, Amanda kept getting reminded of all the ploys she had played to get back at Cassandra, or at least on the pretence of it.</p><p>While the emotion elicited by betrayal is almost ineffable, it carries with it a tinge of resentment and some parts of sorrow, all wrapped up in an insalubrious dose of regret. This was the case with Amanda, as she tried her damndest to play the most elaborate game of <i>‘hide and seek’</i> of her life. She recalled the time when despite having been friends for over two years, she ended up being left for better friends and how when she needed Cassandra to back her up, she left her completely deserted. Clouded with these thoughts, she hardly realized that she hadn’t seen Cassandra in a while. Upon regaining composure, she soon went into a frenzy trying to find her, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda sensed a strange presence from behind her, which to her felt almost akin to Svengali. Through the corner of her eyes, she saw Cassandra walking towards her. Petrified by being in her field of view, Amanda found herself incapable of moving. As Cassandra approached her, her heart raced faster, her palms started sweating, and her breath felt heavier. Despite all of this, the only thing she could fixate on was when would Cassandra find out about her. When Cassandra was about four feet away from her, she acknowledged her presence with a nod, much like one would with any stranger. Amanda looked into her eyes and saw no emotions: no<i> regret, </i>no<i> sorrow, </i>no<i> anger, </i>and no<i> happiness.</i></p><p>The tacit realization of her not even recognizing Amanda brought out the most intense emotions in her, one that emerges from irretrievable loss. Trying to make sense of her emotions, she found herself becoming detached from her surroundings. Even as she stood gazing blankly, a thousand thoughts ran through her mind. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she came to terms with the meaninglessness of her fear, worries, concerns and regrets. Though feeling as if she had been rid of the albatross around her neck, she found herself to be empty and discombobulated, feeling like a large part of her life amounted to nothing.</p><p>Illustration by Tejasv Mohan.</p>",

I saw hundreds of students walking toward their respective destinations. Some were busy talking their hearts out, some were devouring what seemed like food or fighting over it, while others were heading towards their classes, possibly. Simply put, it was all chaos. Although this crowd was a little overwhelming and intimidating initially, it sparked a “chimerical sense” or a world of illusions.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me elaborate on my case. Before the beginning of the classes, I was glued to my laptop. I watched probably a bazillion videos on college life, especially on DTU. I became nervous and feared being left out. From the canteen to classes, daily life to friends, societies to events, I tried to plan it all out by watching those vlogs. I was so determined to showcase my talents and prove myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Little did I know that everything I had mapped out so meticulously would blow up in seconds. Slowly as I started to blend in, I realized that my fellow students and teachers were something I had only hoped for. The sense of inclusivity and camaraderie behind the apparent chaos twisted my emotions altogether. Seniors, who have always been portrayed as the ones who live only to bully their juniors, became my chaperones. At least for me, I have been enlightened at each difficult step and received guidance whenever I needed it. I have seen people enjoying themselves in spite of handicaps and being one irrespective of different cultures, ideologies, and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I have understood the true essence of life and what it really means to be a part of the youth dividend. I would love to delve deeper into the microcosmos we have created here at college while I explore my individuality in this safe space.</p><p><strong>Illustration Credits: Keshav Chauhan</strong></p>",

Gush gush, the ground below his two thick boots crushed. A wide smile shone out of him, barely visible beneath his woolen scarf and beanie. His eyes sparkled as he looked at his surroundings. A tall white blanket covered everything from cars to the trees.</p><p>The boy leaped and landed shortly ahead of him. Bits of white fluff splashed everywhere, landing and assimilating into the rest of the white cushion. His mouth opened agape, letting out a fascinated gasp. He then spun in a circle, stomping his boots repeatedly onto the ground, laughing as each action led to fluffs flying in all directions.</p><p>After many such circles, the boy's attention shifted to the many cars that lined the white field in an orderly manner. Each car was wearing a flat white hat that covered its roof, a white eye mask on its windshield, and a white sweater on its bonnet and trunk. Next to some of the cars were white trees. Each tree periodically sheds some of its white leaves.</p><p>The boy waddled towards one of the cars. He took hold of the car’s hat with his small hands and effortlessly borrowed a piece of it. Even through his big gloves, the boy could feel the cold tingle from the small bit of the hat. Instinctively, he began to crush the bit of the hat. Small bits of icy white sand began to escape through the gaps between the boy’s fingers. The part left in the boy’s hands grew smaller and smaller until it was as hard as a rock. Marveled, the boy tried to further crush the smaller-than-his-palms white rock in his hands. Yet, nothing happened. Disappointed, he let go of the small white rock.</p><p>The boy looked up. The white tree leaves reflected in his eyes. Unable to reach them, the boy stood on his tiptoes-the boy slipped.</p><p>Gush - a loud sound followed.</p><p>A large indent of the boy’s figure formed on his landing spot. Having been saved by the large white carpet below him, the boy began to laugh. He laughed at the concerned voices of his parents till his stomach hurt. Finally, he smiled up at his relieved parents.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Preeti Das, 3rd Year, COE&nbsp;</strong></p>",

Read on to find out.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We're all familiar with a deceptive emotion of euphoria, triggering a wave of sensory overload and engulfing one in a fallacy known as nostalgia. Invoked by a familiar scent, a recognizable tune, or even a memento of the past, we've all had our encounters with nostalgia. Often attributed with a sense of comforting knowingness, this hazy recollection of our past is heavily distorted; or at least that's the way it has been for me.</p><p>Whenever my mind finds itself in a desolate place, a coping mechanism that it resorts to is reminiscing the past through a filter called the 'Good Ol' Days' and comforts itself with a glimpse of the so-called simpler times.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The times have never been simple, never are, and never will be. It is merely the imperfect recollection of a distant memory that presents to us a flawless illusion of the past.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My gripe with nostalgia is not that it evokes a rush of serotonin on encountering a fragment of the past, but rather the fact that it overshadows the present and convinces us to believe that the past was a better time.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In a world where pure, constant happiness is a utopian quest, positive memories are golden but are often at the cost of taking the present for granted.</p></blockquote><p>A detrimental consequence of being a slave to nostalgia is developing a dystopian vision.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When one becomes addicted to viewing a glorified version of the past, everything since seems to pale in comparison, leading to the belief that things have only deteriorated up until now and, naturally, will continue to do so.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong—I'm not here to bash the concept of nostalgia into oblivion. I preach simply to tread with caution on a road that may seem very inviting at first but is plagued with deception and momentary gratification. As long as one can keep in touch with reality and not give in to the illusions of the past, nostalgia is nothing but a friendly reminder of a fond memory.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Tejasv Mohan, 4th Year, B.Des.&nbsp;</strong></p>",

Read on as Abhimanyu Dayal, 2nd Year, SE, navigates through the show of life.</strong></p><p>I stared at the face reflected against the black mirror. It was solemn, silent, numb. Thoughts passed through my mind like bullets, yet my body couldn’t act on them, cryogenically frozen in this instance of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Every show has a pilot, a middle, and a finale. The pilot, the day you entered this shiny new world—you’re curious, excited, even nervous. You meet different people - Some are outspoken, bold, and uncaring of your opinion of them, but you love them. Some people are toxic and nasty, and you wish for their deaths. While some people may just be side characters, you don’t care either way. The pilot sets the environment for you to find your comfort zone, enthralls you, welcomes you into this universe, and you willingly step in.</p><p>Many seasons pass, and new characters come and go. Every episode is different—be it an insane roller coaster ride that keeps you gripping the edge of your seat with wide, unblinking eyes, a moving dive into a character’s mentality, or a simple, uneventful sunny day, enjoying a cup of coffee at your favorite café. In each episode, you get to know your characters just a little better, and every day you smile quietly, unknowingly thanking God they’re a part of your life.&nbsp;</p><p>A day comes, <i>today</i>, when you leave them. You know when the finale is coming, but you can never prepare yourself. The showrunners put effort into giving you a satisfactory ending and a chance to say your goodbyes. You tell yourself you won’t cry, but you never knew yourself if you believed that. The characters move on, and so must you. You cling, at times, to hopes of spinoffs and avidly rewatch old episodes, desperate for that nostalgic rush you felt the first time, but it's never the same.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Cryogenically frozen in this instance of time</i>, if only. Moments can’t be trapped in a bottle, even if they remain on film forever. Watching an episode the first time is a one-time experience, and you must take it in that spirit. The rush, the suspense, the emotions, you can never capture them on a rewatch, you can never capture them in your nostalgic memories.&nbsp;</p><p>After these six seasons, I leave with tear-soaked cheeks and one simple realization, every episode is the pilot, and every episode is the finale. Every moment is just that, a moment. You don’t get a rewatch, because it’s never the same.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Mehak Singhal, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

And I'm the kind who will sever all strands of memories to let go of a person.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm writing this on a metro ride back home from one of the most serene moments I've lived on campus. Sitting on a bench outside Pragya Bhavan, with pretty yellow flowers in front of me, a beautiful peacock coming out of the forest from the side, scattered clouds reflecting the orange of the setting sun, and a boy I somehow dared to ask out, sitting next to me.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I knew it, I had asked him to open Spotify on his phone, and I <strong>played</strong> The Matchstick Pianoman's covers of The Beatles. There, absently staring at the sky with my chin resting on the bench, I found a moment in which I finally realized that the things that bring me calm are more about me than the people they remind me of. And like that, I listened to my favorite instrumental album for the first time in a while and felt at ease with myself. I felt a kind of peace—just sitting there, nearly drowsing off to the sounds that would’ve left me sleepless a month ago, next to a person who barely knew how much the album meant to me but still appreciated the beauty of it.&nbsp;</p><p>With people, leaves music. But with music, come back pieces of me that fell apart in preventing bigger falls—the sights that made me teary-eyed, the sounds that overwhelmed me, the words I could not read, all the scents of the places—come back.&nbsp;</p><p>I tell him, \"Stop! Look at the canopies above us.\" And with me, he stands there staring at the sunlight barely making its way through the envelope of leaves that decorate the skies of Vice Chancellor's Lane. It reminds me of when I exclaimed, \"Let’s go look at the full moon!\" But they didn't. The point isn't that<i> this </i>person beside me looked up but that, regardless, <i>I</i> held my head high and looked at what <i>I</i> loved.</p><p>I had already <strong>stopped</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Photography Credits: Anant Vohra, 3rd Year, ME</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Only the bereft and nocturnals are said to keep awake. However, only the night provides refuge from all the noise and clamor of the day. The nights are dark to the dopey mind but look closely, and you will find a palette of shades beaming. Its trance is akin to the consumable intoxicants that leave you blurry and memoryless, yet, the most memorable. The magic of the night briefly alleviates the indulgence from the characteristically intangible distress of an inconsequential life that is otherwise taken very seriously.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>What about this monochromatic darkness makes it so colorful?</i> This gloom spans a range of hues—jolly, crippling, blurry, introspective, agitated—but invariably melancholic as the dawn nears.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>What makes it so comforting?</i> Black, not just figuratively, but also objectively, absorbs all colors in the visible spectrum. Internalize the blackness and see all the unparalleled vividness come to light. In the tryst with the night, the perception game is played, testing your senses and the lessons you have learned from the realms of the day—silent, quiet, and muted, sometimes a little too loudly deafening, but evocative nonetheless. So silent that the loudest of echoes within the head fall on deaf ears.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>A discreet leeway exists that, coupled with ear-bleeding silence, can make you rejoice with hope or let you shed tears spooked by the ghosts of the past. Either way, only you are privy to it. Visually, nothing loses its luster. It only brings out the true self, which is somewhat masked in colors during the day. If the sun shines and the moon wanes for an almost equal time, then why is it normative to define and view the world from a lens only between dawn and dusk. <i>Is the sky really blue or the grass really green? </i>The diurnal beings that we are must seek to subjugate the complexities of the night, for the reality that it presents us with is unquestionably vibrant—because nights are not just for dreaming but for finding solace in keeping awake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illustration by Shreeya Shrivastav, 4th Year, B.

Certainty is safe, but certainly not fun. Read on as Ananya Rath, 3rd Year, B.Des., helps you walk through the twisty, broken, yet forgiving path of DTU!</strong></p><p><i><strong>My dear ingenuous fresher&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>Congratulations on having made it to DTU! You did it. You survived JEE and years of back-breaking, mentally exhausting coaching for it. Everyone is so proud of you. Maybe you wanted to be somewhere else, but that's okay. You will make peace with it soon.&nbsp;</p><p>You will (hopefully) take all your required classes and join societies and teams where you might find the best of friends, or <i>lessons</i>, depending on your luck and choices. In the end, if the TnP Gods are kind enough to bestow you with their blessings, maybe you will get to heave a sigh of relief in your ceremonial blue shirt after landing an internship or a job.</p><p>But that is a long walk from where you are right now. You are probably still trying to navigate through the maze of SPS classes and being amused by the OAT. If you’re living in the hostels, good luck with the Wi-Fi connectivity (spoiler alert: there’s none) but congratulations on all the experiences you’ll have. Don't worry. You might get better with navigation, and while the fountains will not work 364 out of 365 days in a year, I promise that the allure of things that are quintessential “DTU” in nature will never go away.&nbsp;</p><p>When I started college -Sure, I was boxed up in my room during the first innings of COVID-19- I was excited to start working toward a career I loved. But most of all, I was so freakishly scared. I knew I got in, but what now? What was I supposed to do to be this best version of myself and all the pseudo-intellectual preach I read on Instagram? What would life be like here, and how did I plan for it?</p><p>I know you're expecting an answer, but the truth is, Like most of your seniors, I am still getting surprised every day—for better or worse. Plans change. Things don't work out. You don't get what you want. Life isn't always fair. Or sometimes, things do end up working out in your favor; you never know. And while I theoretically did know all of that, it took surviving DTU to realize the actuality of all this.&nbsp;</p><p>So while I can't tell you what to do and expect, all I can tell with the infinitesimal wisdom of the mere few months I have over you is that college will make you learn. It is a dark and twisty road, and you will be learning to ride a bicycle all alone all over again right here, along with 2000 odd batchmates. These four years will allow you the luxury to be blatantly instinctive and free, and maybe time herself knows it. So she'll put you to the test, bend your back over and over—with mistakes, with the situations you’ll be wrongfully penalized in, with people you should not have trusted, with professors who make you wake up at 7 AM during frigid Decembers, and with every moment you spend here—you will be forced to learn through your laughter, tears, pain, exhaustion, and anger. More importantly, look at college life as a series of gambling tables and play at each table patiently and sincerely; know that there is always a chance and hope ahead; trust your instinct on when to move to the next table instead of betting all the coins at just one.</p><p>I am sorry if I catfished you into thinking this is your cheat sheet to surviving college, but in the words of Taylor Swift the Great (albeit wildly out of context), <i>how can a person know everything at eighteen but nothing at twenty-two?</i> And in your time here, should you happen to stumble upon a roadmap or maybe curate your own survival guide, make sure to have it published in Times!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illustration by Saurabh Sharma, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

The major credit for my subsistence amid Gen Z goes to acting as the interim-youngest-oldie among goshthis of grandparents. However, this is not close enough to know about the stock market shenanigans of the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 2000s. I am only bound to welcome you to my literal interpretation of the dot-com bubble where I reside.</strong></i></p><p>My earliest literature memories from school were a few quintessential poets and writers. I only seem curious about the distinction of each piece of writing. Every article of work carries a degree of strangeness to the beauty of the <i>same</i> <i>world</i> we live in. While writers from the <i>Age of Wordsworth</i> exercised an imaginative impulse on their own perspective of the <i>world</i>, the writer penning this piece of work looks up to a lucent 14-inch window headed by titles with a<i> '.com'</i> suffix for inspiration. My minuscule creativity is fueled (or decelerated?) by occasionally letting myself sink into a seemingly endless haystack where I am meant to find a needle to weave those strands into a basket of stories. There is no longer a hunt for originality, but a quest for original perspectives or articulations remains. Whether that's crawling through artists I don't know well on Spotify or following an uncountable number of aesthetic Pinterest boards until I have forgotten about what I was initially concentrating upon, the palpitations of information trigger periods of thoughtlessness where I squeeze my head to document even a single paragraph.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In the words of Satyajit Ray,<strong> </strong><i>\"If you take some words at random and put them together, it becomes gibberish. But if you string together unrelated moving images, some people will always hold that the celluloid strip aims at some profundity.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>While the infinite assortment of images on the internet is condensed to resemble a mere bioscope, a pen and a poet have, <i>for a long time</i>, chronicled the wars and glory in their entirety. The paralyzed creative anarchist within me questions—<i>how?</i></p><p><br><strong>Illustration by Keshav Chauhan, 3rd Year, EE</strong></p>",

And so, one day in the late summer of this year, I popped open my eyes to decamp from my confidential entanglements as I settled in the midst of an unknown crowd. I agreed with myself to stay hush, even with a palpitating heart and a puppeteered will to indulge in conversations. I clenched my fist to feel my parched skin. I shut my ears to listen to the intonations. I lay inert, sunken into invisibility, on a tenanted warm bench, waiting to welcome fresh realisations. I debated the monologue on an ideal 20-year-old life. I fought against conventional agreements while I recited the hoaxed past two years and negotiated with the mistakes - an awful and unnecessary screenplay; all in my head.&nbsp;</p><p>All this while, as I assigned myself superfluous roles, the downy soft turf, and the summer air hummed poems against my unmindful consensus to introduce me to their comforting prospects. And, as I began to walk around, acquainting myself with unblocked passages, I allowed myself to accept the poetry that followed. Although the verses seemed fuzzy, they persisted to call up my restricted senses. And I then began to harmonise with the cadence of the phrases I could not understand. I fought along with the imperfections they underscored. At the same time, I welcomed all the discomforts - a much-needed, inescapable segue into acceptance and metamorphosis.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, on another day in the late summer of this year, I found myself collapsed on an empty bench in an empty classroom. I clenched my fist once again to feel the same parched skin. I shut my ears again to sing along with the same intonations. I appreciated the solitary conversations - I accepted the devoted affinity between a fictitiously cold, perhaps troubled, and ever-decrepit mortal, and her indissoluble friendly neighbourhood.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Sarthak, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

Read on as Purusharth Seth, 1st Year, MCE, dips a pen in his heart and creates a piece of writing that makes you imagine love, as much as he adores that feeling.</strong></i></p><p>I want you to imagine a cold, cold and dark room, with a little window peeking over and nothing but gloomy silence. The room is quiet, with no noise, a whisper of joy, or any delightful mumble. Then, suddenly, from the window, some light caves in, &nbsp;maybe moonlight. And the room lights up, not to that shiny sunshine, yet enough for one to rejoice. The silence disappears to some foot thumping, perhaps- oh, no! It's drums that are beating, &nbsp;THUMP THUMP THUMP! And back at the window, the moonlight is illuminating, and the room is lightening. It's lighting up with many hues! The room, it's full of vibrant colours, colours of joy, &nbsp;colours of happiness, colours that may even put one to sleep. What is it- Oh!<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The drums are beating faster, in a rhythm now, a true melody, maybe one that makes you sway your arms, lose yourself. Ah! And an angel appears in that vibrant room. Angelic and divine, she dances to the beat, to every thump, as if her soul finds peace in the much dearie calm to us. You hear another melody from behind, &nbsp;a melody putting you to sleep, a deary lullaby. This melody, unlike the beating of drums, doesn't light your soul on fire, instead, this one tells you, it's alright, honey, it's okay. Everything will be okay. You fall away from all the earthly woes. Your soul relaxes, your body calms, and you finally smile peacefully.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The room, that room is my heart, lady. That window is from where your love caved in as light. Those drums? That's my heart beating for you. That angel dancing, rejoicing? That's me being content in your presence. That other calming melody? That's you telling me how much you love me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>",

The fundamental idea is to derive joy from the journey, commemorate the minor triumphs, and craft a colorful and exceptional collage that kindles genuine happiness.</strong></p><p><i>Livsnjutare | (n) A Swedish word meaning, “enjoyer of life”&nbsp;</i></p><p>If you are reading this, congratulations! You’re a human. And if you are a human, there is no denying that you, too, have atleast one dream. Now, I am no one to say that this dream of yours is any lesser or more significant than Mr. Martin Luther King Jr’s dream. However, given that you are here, standing in DTU as a part of a crowd that walked into this place already as the <i>creme de la creme </i>of millions, chances are, you have, what most would consider big dreams.</p><p>An internship at the top recruiting tech company? Placement at an MBB? An ivy-league admit? Or maybe you are still figuring it out.</p><p>I am not going to lie—it is a daunting journey ahead. And the bad part is, you won’t always have a map. But the good part is, that the World is a big place, and if you are resilient enough, life finds a way. In college (and, extension, life), there is no one way to get what you want. It is a process with many milestones, opportunities, exits, and options along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>So if it's a long, confusing, tiring journey ahead, why not celebrate every little thing that brings you joy? I promise you won’t lose sight of your destination if you stop and enjoy a cup of <i>chai </i>along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, what are you, if not an intricate mosaic of all the things, people, and experiences that have left an indelible mark on your life? So choose to make it a happy mosaic. One with millions of little colorful pieces, making it a vibrant, extraordinary, memorable mosaic. Most importantly, make sure it is a mosaic YOU love, your <i>magnum opus</i> celebrating a life so drunk on moments of euphoria and ecstasy that you experienced. Oh! * whispers * and to hell with what the World thinks.</p><p>In the end, you are not who you aspire to be. Still, you can always let your little dreams and achievements, and joys calcify into a beautiful life that you would’ve truly celebrated and enjoyed living.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Saurabh Sharma, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

    "body": "<p>I think there are always some things we never do because we think they’re below us. Concerts, EDM, and party outfits were all those things for me. But a few weeks ago, I attended a concert from center stage with a bunch of strangers, and that made me realize how much - okay, seriously, HOW MUCH - I have been missing out on. As someone who proudly claims to be a 70s kid mentally, I will always love Frank Sinatra and Kishore Kumar more than dhupchik-dhupchik music. Still, letting myself go for once and enjoying everything like those typical “GenZ kids” do felt liberating, almost magical. So here, I strictly instruct you to follow my concert guidelines and have the most fun you can. It doesn’t matter if you don’t know the artist or if you don’t have the right people or the right clothes - just go ahead and have a wild, wild time.</p><p><i><strong>Dress up!&nbsp;</strong></i><br>Do you want to know a secret? Nobody is looking at you at a concert. Everyone is too busy waiting for the artist to arrive or trying to find space to stand straight and not trip and fall over a stranger. So use this opportunity. Take out that dress, that co-ord set that you thought you could never wear. For once, give yourself the freedom to look too feminine, promiscuous, or tacky—no one’s watching, go all out with your wardrobe!&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Go closer to the stage!&nbsp;</strong></i><br>I took a risk with writing this point. Please don’t go break the barricades, scare off the artist, and get beaten up by security. In case you do, please don’t quote me as your muse. Some people prefer standing behind since there’s more dancing space. But for me, a non-dancer, I like being as close to the stage because of the lights. I absolutely love how even with my eyes closed, I can just jump to the flickers of concert lights, not to mention, when you look up, the whole sky is filled with confetti. It’s the most beautiful sight in a fest!&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Shut up and bounce!&nbsp;</strong></i><br>You probably don’t dance. But I know you want to. Even when you don’t know the song, even when everyone around you is dancing - because you’re too shy. So am I. And here I want you to remember the secret I mentioned in Point 1 - nobody’s watching. So do your silly little moves with pride!&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Click a selfie with a stranger&nbsp;</strong></i><br>Okay, you probably will photobomb someone’s picture at least once. If you can’t move elsewhere to avoid coming into someone else’s picture, you might as well pose for it—say cheese!&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Learn a dance move</strong></i><br>Yes, you can get away with just jumping and flailing your arms in the air. But if you’re feeling a little comfortable, challenge yourself to a dance move! Hint: Just look around and find a good dancer to copy. Hint pt. 2: Please don’t creep someone out by staring for too long.&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Get a glitter tattoo!</strong></i><br>It’s not a fest until everything, and everyone sparkles! Find the glitter tattoo stall and get a crazy (no, don’t try to be sophisticated here) tattoo that you never thought you would get! If you’re not catching everyone’s eye, what are you here for?&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Yell that song at the top of your lungs</strong></i><br>We all have a song we’re too embarrassed to know all lyrics of. It’s at least true for someone like me who brags having an acquired taste in music. But you are in DTU, we’re a melting pot of musical tastes which might start with Prateek Kuhad or Dream Note, but it always ends with Jatta Ka Chhora. What do you have to be ashamed of?</p><p>All in all, <i><strong>go wild</strong></i>. Check these boxes after you do it. Trust me, you’ll feel so proud and liberated at the end of it. I hope you make this the best concert night of your life!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illustration by: Mehak Singhal, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

My heart skips a beat. I call my mother, my sister, and my friends, exclaiming, barely catching my own breath. Within a week, I have it all figured out - tickets booked, suitcases packed, university hotspots researched — I am psyched as ever. Oh, all the people I will meet, the things I will learn. I am on a train, going to a different city all on my own, and yet, I feel like I am running. I look outside — and I look back, my life has been a celebration in preparation for a rather larger celebration in the last week.</p><p>I fade out.</p><p>Here I am, a couple of weeks later, going home with a heart and a phone full of memories, and all my brain is asking me now is, “Now what?” Everything in the last three weeks has been like the train I am currently in. But now what? Where is my dopamine rush? Why am I suddenly uncomfortable? Why don’t I feel like I am home when I am not running? Running to a new city, to a new environment, to work, to party? I become a square wave, constantly on an adrenaline high but seeking short-term dopamine highs, again, and again, and again, somehow never finding a shore to rest on.</p><p>Is this how it is supposed to be? Unsettling as it is, I am living in the after-the-party’s-over zone and it forces me to rethink the act of seeking celebration and wondering whether such happiness really is the aim I mean to chase in life. We define landmarks in our lives, festivals, birthdays and achievements, selectively celebrating sand-dunes that are bound to shift, and throw us in the process, into a valley as we try to hold on to the peak.&nbsp;</p><p>Would we be better off if what we were seeking was a plateau?

My heart skips a beat. I call my mother, my sister, and my friends, exclaiming, barely catching my own breath. Within a week, I have it all figured out - tickets booked, suitcases packed, university hotspots researched — I am psyched as ever. Oh, all the people I will meet, the things I will learn. I am on a train, going to a different city all on my own, and yet, I feel like I am running. I look outside — and I look back, my life has been a celebration in preparation for a rather larger celebration in the last week.</p><p>I fade out.</p><p>Here I am, a couple of weeks later, going home with a heart and a phone full of memories, and all my brain is asking me now is, “Now what?” Everything in the last three weeks has been like the train I am currently in. But now what? Where is my dopamine rush? Why am I suddenly uncomfortable? Why don’t I feel like I am home when I am not running? Running to a new city, to a new environment, to work, to party? I become a square wave, constantly on an adrenaline high but seeking short-term dopamine highs, again, and again, and again, somehow never finding a shore to rest on.</p><p>Is this how it is supposed to be? Unsettling as it is, I am living in the after-the-party’s-over zone and it forces me to rethink the act of seeking celebration and wondering whether such happiness really is the aim I mean to chase in life. We define landmarks in our lives, festivals, birthdays and achievements, selectively celebrating sand-dunes that are bound to shift, and throw us in the process, into a valley as we try to hold on to the peak.&nbsp;</p><p>Would we be better off if what we were seeking was a plateau?

I’m not talking about waistcoat-wearing rabbits and a Mad Hatter, but surely the orange marmalades and long hours in the sun. It was a wonderland of joy and imagination and everything felt like it came straight out of Carroll’s head.</p><p>We didn’t have the Cheshire Cat by our shoulders faintly whispering to us, but we had our heroes as our guiding spirits. Simple, ordinary humans with extraordinary personalities. A teacher, a sibling, some public figure or maybe a neighbour. We looked at them with awe and adulation. And while we had a warped view of the world, limited by both our age and experience, we were sure these humans were perfect. Majestic, like a tiger, without any vulnerability. Someone who inspired us to see the world in a different way.</p><p>Strong. Compassionate. Resilient. We emulated all the things that we wished to be.&nbsp; And found our own identities in the process of gaining their appreciation. Completely charmed and enamoured by our heroes, we would often look up to them in moments of uncertainty.</p><p>But once we came out of our rabbit holes to transform into pragmatists, we started to see the cracks in their armours. Our heroes— reduced, lessened, and humbled, perhaps, by the ageing process. With every pound gained, and every hair lost or turned grey, another layer chipped away. We started to see them much like who they were instead of beguiling ourselves with who we wished them to be. Maybe because it was punctuated by our sense of connection with them, or maybe because we didn't quite understand the full spectrum that life has to offer us. But while our perspective on people has evolved to realise their imperfections, we still have the choice to admire them regardless.&nbsp;</p><p>There may not be an archetypal hero in our world, but we can celebrate our anti-heroes just the same, with affection and gratitude.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Tejasv Mohan, 4th Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

Well, the same goes for celebrations too. Celebration is not just a physical event, it is more of an inner sentiment. Be it birthdays, anniversaries, victories or festivals, we try to create everlasting memories each time. People who are close to us make us feel delighted by organising a “great”&nbsp; event and topping it off with a myriad of gifts. Over the years, the word “celebration” has taken on a factitious meaning. Today, we seek to be amused or entertained. It has become more of a materialistic and exaggerated effort. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with expectations and so, often people don't get fully satisfied with whatever they get. The onerous efforts go in vain when people have high, lavish expectations of a celebration. Should we not be grateful for the heart that they have put into making us happy? Well it's the other way round too. We expect that whatever we have given or done will surely make the other person happy. These expectations perhaps make us weak. Weak in expressing, thanking and living life to the fullest. So, it's a forever learning that even if we don't get what we desire we should be thankful and appreciative of the feelings, efforts and hard work of the other person. We should not forget that life’s under no obligation to give us what we expect. We should behave decently without the expectation of rewards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illustration by Sarthak Sharma, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

At that moment, the blanket feels warmer, the bed feels cosier, and no matter how short-lived, that feeling of total bliss seems unmatched.</p><p>Our lives are full of such little bundles of joy scattered across our quotidian quests. The subconscious celebration of these cherishable moments is one of the most beautiful ways of paying homage to the virtues of the human spirit. These moments may seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but our innate elation is evidence that we do not live in the grand scheme of things after all.</p><p>There are moments of obvious joy. I say obvious because there is usually a societal consensus on the celebration of such events. Birthdays, weddings, festivals - you get the idea. Now, sipping on that perfect cup of tea while basking in the sun may pale in comparison to the glamour of a party for some people. However, the joy that I derive from moments where there is no expectation of it distinguishes these nuggets of happiness from the moments of obvious joy.</p><p>At a time when happiness has become increasingly scarce, finding beauty and significance in the ordinary moments of life and recognizing that they can be just as meaningful as grand or extraordinary events is a boon to humankind. In the quest for true bliss, we tend to venture far and wide in the hope of coming across the secret to happiness, all the while neglecting the pieces of the puzzle we encounter on the journey.</p><p>I believe these unexpected moments of gratification are what inherently drives us and compels us to look forward to things. Perhaps what compelled me to write this was the subconscious expectation of the unexpected, the joy I can now experience, having finished writing.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Tejasv Mohan, 4th Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

He is thankful for the experiences that have shaped him and revels in his metamorphosis.</strong></p><p><i>(Based on the story by Carlo Collodi)</i></p><p><i>“Once upon a time, there was a piece of wood, not an expensive piece of wood, a common block of firewood.” </i>My name is Pinocchio, I am an ordinary piece of wood. As a leaf quivers, as a bird sets sail; as a mother sings, as this story begins - I remain ordinary, I remain masked. I am indifferent and mute; still and all, tender and impassioned. I am impatient, maybe ungrateful, impulsive, and naive. I like the mellow springs, I like the chilly nights. I am a little warm, enmeshed in strings - mute with a hundred poems, unveiled with assumed emotions.</p><p><i>“Lies, my boy, are known in a moment. There are two kinds of lies, lies with short legs and lies with long noses. Yours, just now, happen to have long noses.” </i>After every lie was another lie; and a truth behind each. I refused to accept the roses, the sunflowers, the lilies; I refused to share the sunshine. <i>“Good boys always tell the truth.” “I am Pinocchio, and I always tell lies.” </i>I have been dishonest. I have been belligerent, and gluttonous, I know. But I have also walked past being barely human.<i>“To-morrow I cease to be a puppet, and I become a boy like you and all the other boys.” </i>Rummaging through the paraphernalia of my strings, I have always promised to prune them. I always fit into the shapes carved by others, colouring myself into their lines, and committing myself to a seamless marathon of fitting in. One for the laugh and two for the show, I begin my race. But <i>how do I win when I want to lose this race?</i></p><p>I have danced my way through some beautiful days, forgetting when I’d trip and bumble and shamble. <i>“I met some really nice people, Jiminy. They helped me and they didn’t even have to.” “Well, that’s what friends do.” </i>Today, I celebrate my individuality - my peculiarity. I celebrate my flawed story with cheers, woo hoo, huzzah! And I write this to the friends and the toasts and celebrations, for the moments unforgettable, and to what has made me human - <i>I am Pinocchio, I’ve got no strings to hold me down. </i>And, to the celebration of truthful friendships - it is you why I have no wretched mask today, why I have uncovered my vulnerabilities and strengths, soaking emotions into my heart. I now feel the sentiments of humans being puppeteered by situations, and my heart beats enunciated, like a marionette in a high wind - I feel belongingness. I celebrate that today I have a human heart encased in a rock-solid piece of wood. I celebrate when I look out at the world, which is always so unusually sparkling, when I feel a sense of eeriness, just like a common human. I feel the wind, I adore its modesty, and fear the wrath. My name is Pinnochio, <i>and I am a real boy.</i></p><p><strong>Illustration by Sarthak Sharma, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

It’s an experience. Fests are one thing I have been super excited about ever since Aarambh. Attending Raghav Chaitanya’s concert from center stage, with trippy lights that I could feel even with my eyes closed, was the beginning of my love for concerts. There has been no looking back.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerts are like a big party for one. Everyone’s dancing to their own beat, barely concerned about what the people around them would think if they saw them making silly dance moves. For once, in your life full of impatience, you stand in lines and wait for an artist to arrive. You hoot. You shout. You laugh. You smile. You cry. You look up to the blinking lights, the confetti, the fireworks—and for once, you are not ashamed of anything. You hold your chest, and you cannot tell if what you’re feeling is the music or your heartbeat. It’s all one. Even standing there amongst hundreds of strangers, maybe a couple of friends, with very little space and a lot of dust—you’re a happy kid.&nbsp;</p><p>I am a girl who only listened to 70s rock and western classical. But in DTU, you cannot remain restricted in your music taste. Since December, I’ve been the girl who plays Ndee Kundu, DG Immortals, Bollywood, EDM, and whatnot—on repeat. I never thought I would be the person crazily dancing to Jhotte or Kaleshi Chhori in a crowd of unknown people, but I am now. And I am more than happy and proud to be that kid.&nbsp;</p><p>Fests from your own college always have a special place in your heart. I went to Mood Indigo in December, and ever since, I have been eagerly waiting to see what EngiFest would be like. For the last month, I have been planning outfits, daydreaming about walking into a decorated college, and going to concerts of artists I might not even know about. There was so much planning that went into it.&nbsp;</p><p>But now, as I write this, it's not a fest day anymore. Around me, I see everyone packing up and cleaning, taking off stalls. I can see every staircase of the OAT today. There are no stage lights, no artist I am waiting for. Today, I’m just sitting in the OAT on a bench facing three lifesized posters and five strings of paper art hanging from the clocktower, wondering if it’s ever going to be the same again.</p><p>As a COVID student, I only get one more time at EngiFest. Maybe it's not the same next year—maybe my eighth semester workload overrides my urge to attend every concert next year, maybe I’m no longer with the friends who helped me pick my outfits this time, dealt with an overenthusiastic friend who kept moving from room-to-room with the only mirror in the flat, kept me safe in a Delhi crowd, let me glitter them up in every concert, taught me silly dance steps in afterparties, and stopped me from overdosing on chocolate.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe next year will be very different, with different people and different circumstances. Perhaps it’s too soon to be thinking about it already, I know it is. So I will try to keep myself sane by telling myself how times are fleeting, and hope for the best in the year to come.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Photography Credits: Anant Vohra, 3rd Year, ME</strong></i></p>",

When David Gilmore’s chords made time stand still, the deepest dormant emotions jolted. When Adele hit a high note, eyes closed and the head lifted.</p><p>Music is just another apparatus to haul into a dimension only known to an individual away from the clang of the world that we all share. It’s like the sweet few seconds right after the splash when you dive into a pool completely feeling yourself and the sketchy fast moving thoughts halt guising as if it was until eternity before returning to the surface.</p><p>It is here, in this alternative reality that makes your head sway and body groove. If there are a thousand genres then there are a million more ways to unravel them because each melody attunes differently to various intonations since songs are tickets to a universe in your subconscious continuously being built by experiences and memories and aestheticised by perceptions wherein your creative self can unboundedly hover around, foray into a multitude of possibilities, dream, imagine and take comfort while basking in abundant emotions.</p><p>This space is yours to the hilt, celebrate and dance like nobody’s watching, cry as if it were a loyal friend you share profound sorrows with, abscond from the noise of existence and take refuge for it is your safe place. The belongingness here is comforting that stays put to the utmost degree of companionship.</p><p>From the facade of it, the life flourishing beneath cold and dry frozen lakes isn’t apparent but there subsists commotion, complexity and discomposure. Similarly, the rollercoaster of emotions steering from our sound of music within, making us go astray from the actualities of life, doesn’t manifest outside comprehensively making only us aware of it. The assortment of fantasies experienced as a main character in our la la land are far and wide but solely ours. Music can bring out a smile or leave you teary eyed, discerning abstractions of love, solitude, nostalgia, remembrance, immortality and regret amongst countless others.</p><p><strong>Illustration by Shreeya Shrivastav, 4th Yr, B.Des.</strong></p>",

Expectations need to end somewhere, else you’re just running into oblivion.”<br><i>“If you know that, then why do you do it? Why do you beat yourself up by setting impossible standards?”</i></p><p>“I’m worried, scared, that the world would chew me up if I’m not the best. It feels like a war, and nothing short of absolute perfection can get me through it.”</p><p><i>“Do you think your fears are justified? Are you actually as expendable as you think you are?”</i></p><p>“There are people who care about me, and to them I’m not. But there are far more people who don’t. To them, my grades, my skills and abilities, that’s what defines my worth.”</p><p><i>“How about me? What is my worth to you?”</i></p><p>“Do I care about you? I don’t know.

One of the key strategies that the council likely used to manage the challenges posed by the pandemic was to embrace digital platforms and move events online. Additionally, we also focused on organising events that were more feasible to conduct during this time such as online poetry slams, online dance competitions, online debates and webinars on various topics. Furthermore, the cultural council also used this time to build their digital presence and engage with students through various social media platforms. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the DTU Cultural Council demonstrated tremendous resilience and resourcefulness.</p><p><strong>What is more difficult—reaching out to artists, planning the event or procuring sponsorships?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The decision-making process for the DTU cultural council typically involves a combination of inputs from the council members, feedback and suggestions from the student body, and research on current cultural trends and events. The council meets regularly to discuss and brainstorm potential ideas for events and activities, taking into consideration factors such as feasibility, budget, and representation of various cultures. Ultimately, the Cultural Council's goal is to create inclusive and engaging cultural experiences for the entire DTU community.</p><p><strong>Give a little insight into the decision-making process by the council and how it comes up with ideas and approaches artists?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Each of these elements of planning a cultural event can present its own set of challenges. Reaching out to artists can be difficult for a number of reasons. For example, popular or well-known artists may be in high demand and have busy schedules, making it difficult to secure their participation in an event. Planning an event can also be challenging, since it involves coordinating a variety of different elements, such as securing a venue, arranging logistics and transportation, coordinating with artists and performers, and marketing the event. Procuring sponsorships can be a difficult task too, as it requires convincing potential sponsors that the event will be beneficial for them and that they will get a good return on their investment.</p><p><strong>The Cultural Council in DTU is synonymous with grand events and fests on a huge scale. However, this past year has been a struggle for everyone, juggling and shuffling between online and offline modes of college. How was this managed and overcome by the cultural council?</strong></p><p>Organising events as council members requires a great deal of leadership and teamwork. Through this experience, you learn valuable skills in teamwork, communication, and leadership. Planning of cultural events requires creative thinking and the development of innovative ideas as well, which hones one's creativity and problem-solving skills. The past year has also been a challenging one, with the pandemic changing the way events can be organised. Adapting to the situation and coming up with new ways to organise events and engage students despite the challenges is a valuable skill.</p>",

This is because prior to that you are still being moulded and affected by parents but in college you are completely independent. I wish I had spent more time studying but I didn't. One of the things I realised was how much I liked studying. In our education system there is a lot of cramming and contrary to reality, you are expected to remember everything and perform every task.</p><p><strong>How do you think India can move towards a more concept-oriented system of education?</strong></p><p>It is slowly trying to. In my observation, education here seems to be a source of pressure. Education is extremely significant in high school because it builds the basics. Exposure in college is very different and the biggest thing to master in life is how to deal with people. You can keep learning but not be able to apply it. So college is the time where you learn how to learn.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What prompted your shift to finance and business?</strong></p><p>My interest was in motivating people, so I switched to industrial engineering, which had a lot more to do with statistics, psychology and management. I can walk into a room, talk to 5 people, lay out a dream and make sure they follow through with it, which is just motivating people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Since you’ve been into Venture Capital, a highly competitive space, what is your take on the Indian Startup Ecosystem and any piece of advice for budding entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>I think it's getting a lot of traction right now. In this instance, I have suggested that professors work with alumni to assist them with financing, as they are in a better position to guide them. There is no dearth of ideas, but problems arise when Venture Capitalists are unable to identify the needs of the country. This is where the role of entrepreneurs comes in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think Indian universities should also form alumni associations that periodically contribute to their institutions?</strong></p><p>I’m a strong advocate of alumni associations funding programmes and infrastructure developments at universities and have spoken to people about the same. Alumni organisations should represent the campus, be managed by the campus and not by external organisations. A certain pride is associated with being an institution's alumni, and it is important that alumni have the opportunity to contribute to similar initiatives since we ourselves feel we owe the institution a debt of gratitude.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, what is the motivation behind funding the dreams of entrepreneurs and what is your thesis for identifying successful companies?</strong></p><p>You get about a hundred ideas a month and only consider a handful of them for further evaluation. You can cull the number down further to just one while having a strong understanding of that sector. At the founder’s level, they need to be extremely convinced and passionate about their idea. Your belief needs to be very strong because Venture Capitalists are not just investing in a concept but also in the ability of the team to actually make something happen.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to the students of DTU?</strong></p><p>Enjoy your time. One talent you must have is the ability to communicate. You may have the most brilliant idea but if you cannot present it effectively, you can’t make progress. This applies in all spheres of professional life. So, take time and become a very proficient communicator.</p>",

Can you tell us a little bit about your experience at Intel?</strong></p><p>The reason why I’m associated with that title is that I led the team responsible for the Pentium program to success and glory. Now to earn that responsibility, I had to work on the predecessors of the Pentium. Having worked on earlier versions of the chip, I had experience of chip design and fabrication. I had consistently shown the management that I could handle complex projects, deal with setbacks, and manage a team of engineers through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you believe in the ideology that multiple failures can lead to success?</strong></p><p>The key is to learn from failure. Whenever we say that it is okay to fail, we are referring to striving hard to accomplish something, and in doing so, it is implicit that you will fail. Consequently, you’ll try more, learn more and, as a result, get farther each time. Another thing to note is that you are not the only person who will fail; anyone who wishes to take the same path will have to go through the same process. The one advantage you can gain over the competition is the “first-mover advantage”, wherein starting out early will put you ahead.</p><p><strong>In the late 90s, when you left Intel to join NextGen, it must have been a difficult step to take. Can you tell us more about that decision?</strong></p><p>It was difficult to leave from an emotional point of view. However, I was at a crossroads at that point. Having closely witnessed the rise of Silicon Valley, it was evident that the glamour of California was due to the booming and fast-growing startups in Silicon Valley. At 45, it is somewhat out of the ordinary to try one’s hand at startups. However, I had this nagging feeling that if I didn’t step out now to expose myself to this underground world of startups, I would miss out. So I went ahead and got financial advice. In response to my concerns, my advisor assured me that the decision I made would not adversely affect my prospects for a secure future, regardless of whether the startup was successful. That was my cue to go and do what my heart told me to do, making leaving Intel the second-best thing I had done, the best being joining Intel.</p><p><strong>You’ve seen the Indian and the international educational infrastructure very closely. What do you feel is lacking in the Indian education infrastructure?</strong></p><p>The biggest drawback of the Indian education system is the inability to provide hands-on training. For example, in VLSI, not only do you have to design a chip, but you also have to fabricate the chip and test it. More learning is accomplished through practical training in laboratories, particularly in fields like physics, electronics, etc.</p><p><strong>What do you think motivates you? What is something you’ve learnt from your college experience and is there any advice you would give to anyone who wishes to follow in your footsteps?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think what motivates me is to make a difference. It’s like my mind is programmed a certain way - after a few days it starts nagging me to be productive. In view of the accidental nature of our existence, I believe the advice I will offer is to make a difference. That is, make the planet you leave a better place than the planet you came into. If that becomes your aim, as it did for me, the next step is to find that passion that will sustain you for a long time. This is because you will only see the results after a long time. When you find that passion, it goes beyond work, it becomes joy. If you can find yourself in that state, where all work becomes joy, you will also be working 18 hours a day, regardless of age.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can the youth of India contribute to developing a more experience-based learning ecosystem?</strong></p><p>Since the actual setup of such a system is very capital-intensive, it is difficult for the youth to pull off something of this sort independently. Something which the youth can focus on and that I find lacking in the younger generation is developing a mindset of creativity and innovation. There is a lot of emphasis on knowing things, getting good grades, and passing exams, whereas I believe that sometimes it is okay for the student to fail. In this way, many individuals would be able to venture out of their comfort zones, who might have been confined due to the fear of failure.</p>",

I used to efficiently balance my time between work, giving mocks, and analysing them.'</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Varnit Sharma, EP, Class of 2021 who scored a 99.98 percentile in the CAT examination 2022.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Being an engineer, what do you think was your inspiration behind choosing CAT?</strong></p><p>My father knew I would be an engineer long before I did, which is how I landed at DTU. During my college years, I got an opportunity to work with a society now known as DEPTH-DTU. When I joined, the society was dormant, and I was responsible for reviving it. This responsibility kept me up at night and had me roaming the corridors of the BCH Hostel, thinking of ways to get better engagement. Around that time is when I realised that this was something that pushed me to get more done.</p><p>To follow this passion, I started taking up similar projects, and eventually, I ended up at Bain Capability Network, which is the closest I could get to my passion after B.Tech. After working at BCN for a couple of years, I decided that I wanted to be involved in a more up-front role in which my work is not just limited to analytics. This was when I decided to go for an MBA.</p><p><strong>What was your preparation strategy for the CAT exam?</strong></p><p>There are three sections in the CAT paper - namely Verbal Ability &amp; Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI &amp; LR), and Quantitative Aptitude. VARC deals with your reading comprehension, the DILR section tests how well you can make decisions in the spur of the moment, and the quant section requires brushing up on the theoretical aspect of quantitative aptitude, which most engineers have in place. I primarily built my concepts by giving mock exams. I gave around 150 mocks in the past two years, analysed where I went wrong in each paper and followed up by studying the topics I lacked. Practice and consistency are key to scoring well on the exam. I used to efficiently balance my time between work, giving mocks, and analysing them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What difference do you feel exists between JEE and CAT, in terms of both, preparation and competition?</strong></p><p>The biggest difference between JEE and CAT, from my experience, was that CAT had a very small syllabus as compared to JEE. CAT is all about your aptitude, the type of questions are all based on quick thinking ability, logical reasoning and such. It’s all about how quickly the solution comes to you when you’re sitting in the exam hall.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of competition though, I feel like CAT is trickier than JEE. In JEE, after getting a decent rank, one can safely say he or she will get a college. In CAT, you need to achieve an extraordinarily high percentile just to be eligible for a call from an IIM ABC. That is not to say that CAT is tougher than JEE, I would definitely say that JEE is trickier, but it has a much larger window of opportunity than CAT.</p><p><strong>How do you see your career evolving from here? What are your future plans?</strong></p><p>It’s always been my dream to be able to give back to those less fortunate than myself and make a meaningful impact. I feel like India as a country could evolve a lot if we could bring education to underprivileged kids, and I would like to, maybe far down the line, be able to bring about that change. Of course, as I said, this is a bit far down the line, but it’s my dream to reach the point where I can eventually make that difference.</p>",

    "body": "<p>DTU Times interviewed Manmeet Dhody, CTO of PayTm, during Invictus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does a typical day at the PayTm office look like?</strong></p><p>Digitizing payments and financial services for all Indians, and we’re working towards making that mission a reality. The majority of people in India don’t have access to credit. We do our jobs and have different roles and are focused on making that vision a reality. Whatever it takes to ensure that every Indian will have access to credit because when you do have access to credit, it allows you to grow your business and start new initiatives, especially for people who don’t get credit like the common person. So, all of us are focused on making that a reality.</p><p><strong>PayTm is a household name in India, but other giants like Amazon and Google are now entering the same market. How do you analyze and stay ahead of the competition?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are focused on customers—India and Indians.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Our focus is to digitize payments for all Indians and solve all kinds of problems, i.e., providing access to credit, the ability to pay your bills, and accepting payments for you whether you're an online, offline, small, or big merchant. That razor-sharp focus gives us an advantage. We are completely focused on our customers—consumers and merchants.</p><p><strong>What gave birth to the idea of a payment voice box?</strong></p><p>Once people started accepting payments, you could go to any merchant, scan their QR and make payments. However, sometimes you might show an image that you have made the payment, but it's not very easy to verify. There is a demand&nbsp; for this - if the merchant could hear that he has received the money and would be assured that money has come into his account. That gave birth to the idea of a payments voice box. PayTm was the first to bring audio-based payment confirmations with the Soundbox.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What strategies have you adopted to stay up to date with the latest technology?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I am a strong believer in cloud computing. There are no two ways about it, the kind of scale we have where we do millions and millions of transactions every hour, which only increases daily.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>You won’t be able to handle that scale without being on the cloud, which helps you in two ways. Some basics are already built for you, like the ability to scale your transactional systems. Some technologies will do that scaling for you.</p><p>Similarly, databases in the cloud can scale to a very, very large scale, which speeds up computing. We ensure that we collaborate with the best cloud computing providers in the country. We also train our technology teams with the latest cloud technologies within PayTm. This helps us to innovate faster because when you spend time building basic blocks, you need to innovate faster.</p><p><strong>How did PayTm venture into movie ticketing services?</strong></p><p>These are the services people love to have. You can make payments to friends and merchants and transfer money to anyone, and you’ll also want to do additional things in commerce. And for us, we wanted to make a one-stop solution for all these things, and it also helps us get many more consumers through this channel. Today, PayTm is the only Super App in India, which is trusted by millions of Indians.</p><p><strong>What would you describe as your biggest passion as CTO?</strong></p><blockquote><p>My biggest passion that I’m trying to fulfill at PayTm is to improve the lives of Indians and make that happen through the availability of credit because the majority do not have access to credit. Either they can't dream of something bigger, or they end up taking credit from pensive sources, and then they have to pay huge amounts of interest on those loans.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So, what we have been able to do as you look at our latest numbers is that we provided a loan of Rs.3,600 crores approximately in December. These are small loans ranging from Rs.10,000 to Rs. 3 lacs. That kind of microcredit for people is life-changing. That is the biggest achievement for me as the CTO.</p><p><strong>Is it the responsibility of private firms like PayTm to provide small micro credits, or should the government be taking it up?</strong></p><p>The government definitely has a role in this, but the government also looks at private partnerships to make some of these things happen. That's where we stepped into this. It's where we all work together. Given that people transact on our platform, we can make informed decisions on the amount of credit to provide to them.</p><p><strong>How can we ease the small merchants to accept payments through UPI rather than cash?</strong></p><p>As the pioneers of QR, PayTm has taken UPI to every nook and corner of the country. Today, even small merchants like fruit or vegetable vendors are very happy to take payments through UPI or wallets because we settle this money instantly in their bank account, which gives them confidence. So that change has happened, in my opinion, in big cities, and in smaller cities, things are moving in that direction. Though some merchants might prefer cash, the majority have already moved towards it, which is good for India.</p><p><strong>Recently, we heard that big companies laid-off employees. What strategy would you suggest for engineers or students to stay relevant in the market?</strong></p><p>Join PayTm. We don’t mass fire. There were unique events that triggered this. I have never seen such events in my career, and it’s a combination of Covid-19. Some sectors saw a lot of jump in demand at that time, and some companies over-hired beyond their capability. Such a large number of employees probably led to this.&nbsp;</p><p>For students, I would suggest focusing on your courses and subjects. Do your projects well in college. Most importantly, work hard. This combination will allow you to always stay relevant in the market.</p><p><strong>Do you believe in hustle culture, or prefer a more laid-back approach while balancing mental health, personal life, and work life?</strong></p><p>I don’t differentiate between these two terms.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>If you are passionate and lucky enough to work on something you are passionate about, it's no longer work, which is the key thing.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Try to find something that you love doing. All of us have to maintain good mental and physical health.</p><p><strong>What would you say to students giving up their passion for a high-paying job? What exactly do you look for in SDE roles when recruiting?</strong></p><p>In my time, it used to be that most of us first focussed on getting a good-paying job or pursuing higher education, though there were exceptions. Things have changed today and there are a lot more opportunities for people to focus on pursuing their passions. The best combination is when you are passionate about the work you do. Everyone in DTU is smart. I look for people who have done their courses well and do their assignments and projects diligently. Sparks of innovation are always an added plus.</p>",

Read on as Bilal Khan, 2nd Year, MCE, reiterates the strong message that when everything is lost, hope just isn’t. We just need a tread down some road, have our own journey, and “learn and move on”.</strong></i></p><p>With blue toes and lost hope, I walk on the cold and obsolete road with moist asphalt rubbing against my coarse sole. Completely lost and gave up on life, backstabbed by the ones I trusted, treachery written all over my destiny. A miserable life, full of regrets and sorrows. I have given up on life, its very meaning and purpose. I am constantly looking for answers to my existence yet failing every single time.</p><p>Distressed, defeated, done. I start meandering along the path deflected by rock-hearted humans, bereft of any compassion. Thus, begins an excursion of sorts, a map futile, a reason hostile, going wherever my tired feet drag me towards. A journey I am skeptical about, what good will it do? With a drained and derailed spirit, I start this walk toward hopelessness and zero possibilities.</p><p>A joyous seven-year-old who seemed to have no regrets confided in me that she wished she had never met that mean girl who hurt her tender heart. A small yet early experience about human behaviour had the little one sad and silent but with a hope of looking for the good in the future, she smiled at me and said, “<i>I will learn and move on.”</i></p><p>I walked further to meet a boy inching towards the end of his teenage years who had regrets about having flung off school which otherwise could have brought a change in fortunes for him. He wished to have done better but with the moisture of regret yet pulsed hope in his eyes, he lifted his head and stated with determination, “<i>I will learn and move on.”</i></p><p>Then I came across a middle-aged man who shared his remorse for his deceased wife whom he wished to have loved more when she was alive. He wept the loss of his sunshine, his love, his hope. But caressing his infant daughter’s little forehead with his sweaty fingers and giving it a deft kiss, his eyes full, he told me, <i>“I will learn and move on.”</i></p><p>Towards the end of the road, I encounter an old man with aching knees and receding health. He sat over the vast wealth and wisdom he had garnered. He received the reverence and status of a respectable man in society. A life that seemed perfect and complete to me. But there he sat with his wife, both wishing that their children came to see them more often. Clenching his woman’s hands with his creased palms, he looked at me and muttered in a low and shaky voice, “<i>I will learn and move on.”</i></p><p>My feet gained strength, my back became straighter, and a strange, comforting feeling of gratitude sealed the opening in my heart that had been there all this while. Lessons that were known yet far from known, were unravelled to me. The unanswered got answered. A walk down an unknown path brought about some serendipitous discoveries along the way. Hope never dies, it just can’t, look around and you would see people clinging to their lives even after everything seems lost to them. It was the revelation of the truth about our lives, that no matter how desolate and despairing we consider our destiny to be, never give up on hope, never give up on ourselves, never give up on the infinite possibilities, and just keep walking, just step out, just <i>“learn and move on.”</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

एक ऐसी यात्रा जिसमे अधूरेपन का एहसास न हो। जो जितनी संपूर्ण हो, उतनी ही खाली भी हो। वास्तव में पूरा हो जाना या खाली हो जाना एक ही सिक्के के दो पहलू हैं। हमारी जिंदगी इन दोनों सिरों को पा लेने की कोशिश में ही बीत कर रह जाती है। क्या अंत और अनंत एक दूसरे से अलग होकर होकर अधूरे नहीं हैं? क्या इनकी सीमा भी सीमित नहीं है? वैसे जीवन यात्रा के ये अनसुलझे सवाल कभी ख़त्म तो होंगे नहीं। तो आइए पढ़ते हैं मेरी लिखी एक छोटी सी कहानी - एक अधूरा अनंत।</p><p>पूस की अंधेरी रात थी। आकाश पर तारे भी ठिठुरते हुए मालूम हो रहे थे। मैं भी दिन-भर की ऊबन और थकान के बाद हीटर जलाकर आग ताप रहा था। जैसे-जैसे समय बीत रहा था, रात शीत को हवा से और धधकाते जा रही थी। फ़ोन भी इस ठंड मे गर्मी का एहसास ले रहा था। दरअसल वह दिन भर की थकान के बाद चार्ज होकर पुनः सेवा देने के लिए उपलब्ध हो रहा था। घंटी धीरे-धीरे तेज़ होने लगी थी और मेरे फ़ोन के अपाहिज होने के कारण मुझे ही अपने तन को चादर की ओट से बाहर लेकर जाना पड़ा। देखा तो कोई अनजान नंबर था सो मैंने मन कचोट कर कॉल काट दिया। परंतु मेरे आराम मे खलल तब पड़ा जब वही कॉल दोबारा आया। मेरे मन में न जाने क्यों संशय बढ़ने लगा पर फिर दिमाग ने कहा कि मुझे फ़ोन लगाएगा हीं कौन? सालों से किसी दोस्त ने मेरे दर पर दस्तक दी नहीं थी और जो देते भी, वो अपने दुखड़े सुनाकर पुरानी बातों का मलाल करने लगते। अरे भाई! अब जो हो गया उसका रोना रोने से क्या होगा। उनको सांत्वना देकर मैं भी फ़ोन जैसे तैसे रख देता। वह कॉल भी अपनी आखिरी साँस लेते हुए कटने ही वाला था कि मैंने दया करके उसे अपने कान के पास जगह दी। तभी एक हेलो ने मानों, इस सर्द रात मे मुझे लेह के बर्फ़ानी पहाड़ों मे वीरान छोड़ दिया। करीब सात साल बाद श्रेया की आवाज सुनकर मैं वैसे हीं थर्रा गया था जैसे बरसों पहले सिहर जाता था। वक़्त मानो थम सा गया था। मैंने हड़बड़ाहट में पूछा- \"कौन!\" जवाब मे प्रश्न से स्वागत हुआ कि \"इतनी जल्दी भूल गए?\" जल्दी! क्या सात साल कोई बच्चों का खेल है जो जल्दी बीत गया। शायद आज तक मैं उन कष्टदायी रातों को नहीं भूल पाया था जो उसके अचानक दूर चले जाने पर मुझे मिले थे। खैर! मैंने उससे अचानक अरसों बाद मुझे याद करने का कारण पूछा तो जवाब आया की \"नाराज़ लगते हो।\" देखिए, अब नाराजगी की कोई बात नहीं है, सिवाय इसके कि मेरे गत सालों के अनगिनत प्रयासों के बावजूद उसका न तो कोई कॉल आया था और न ही कोई मैसेज। सच कहूँ तो मुझे पता भी नहीं था कि वह ज़िंदा भी है या नहीं। मेरे दिमाग में पुरानी यादों का घेरा सा बनना शुरू हो गया था। मुझे याद आया कि करीब सात साल पहले हीं तो मैंने उसे प्रोपोज़ किया था और उसने न हाँ कहा और न ही ना। कितना मनहूस पल था वो भी। शायद क्षितिज के उन अनंत बिंदुओं को भी तलाश होती होगी न किसी प्रामाणिकता की कि क्या आकाश उन तक सीमित है भी या नहीं। शायद मुझे भी उसके जवाब का उतना ही इंतज़ार था। उसकी सादगी की तो क्या ही बात करूँ। आधा स्कूल उसके पीछे पागल था। एक वाक्य में बयान करना हो तो उसका चेहरा मानो गहरी सवालिया आंखें लिए सीधा दिल में झाँकती तस्वीर जैसी था। ​हम स्कूल में काफ़ी अच्छे दोस्त थे। मुझे फोटोग्राफी का बहुत शौक था पर उसे बिल्कुल भी नहीं। \"अरे! इधर देखो ना यार।\" उसकी तस्वीरें यही कहकर तो खींचता रहता था मैं और वह बार-बार अजीब सी शक्ले बनाकर, आँखे जानबूझकर बड़ी कर के, मुझे तंग करती थी। \"मुझे नहीं आता यार ये पोज़ वोज देना। ऐसे ही खींच लो।\" उसने चिढ़कर कहा था और फिर मेरे जिद करने पर मेरा कहा मान कर खड़ी हो गई थी। उसकी फोटो मेरी खींची हुई सबसे सुंदर तस्वीर है जो आज भी मेरी पर्स के ऊपरी पॉकेट में सुरक्षित है। अचानक से मेरा हाथ मेरी पर्स की ओर बढ़ा और उसकी तस्वीर निकल कर बाहर आ गई। काफ़ी समय तक पर्स में रहने के बावजूद वह तस्वीर आज भी बिल्कुल वैसी ही थी जैसे आज ही खींची गई हो। वहीं चेहरा और उसपर वहीं कत्थई आँखें जिनमे अल्हयदा से ख्वाब रहा करते थे। वहीं पेशानी और उसपर वहीं शिकन जिसपर न जाने कितने सवाल बसा करते थे। पता नहीं वह अब भी पहले जैसी होगी या नहीं। यह सब सोचते हुए मेरे आँखों में नमी सी आने लगी। मैं उन दिनों अपने कैमरे में सब कुछ कैद कर लेना चाहता था। नदियों की कलकल, वीराने में पसरे सन्नाटे, अंधेरे की गहराइयां, आसमान में उड़ते पंछी, सड़कों पर दौड़ते बच्चे, बेबाक मुस्कुराहटें, रोते हुए चेहरे। हर एक चीज जो आम आँखें नहीं देख पाती। मैं वो सारी तस्वीरें खीचना चाहता था जो सिर्फ तस्वीर होने की सीमा में न बंधकर देखने वाले के मन में गहरे उतर जाएं। मुझे पता ही नहीं लगा कि कब मैं उसकी एक के बाद एक तस्वीर खींचता हुआ अपने ख्यालों में बने फ्रेम को मुकम्मल करने के लिए उसके दिल के इतना करीब पहुँच गया जहाँ से सिर्फ दोस्त बन कर रह पाना मेरे लिए मुश्किल होता जा रहा था।&nbsp;</p><p>मैं उसे पाने की कोशिश में उसकी गहरी दोस्ती से वंचित नहीं होना चाहता था पर उसके चुप हो जाने की वजह से मेरे दिन और रात में एक अलग सी उदासी आ गई थी। अब दुनिया उतनी खूबसूरत नहीं जान पड़ रही थी जितनी कुछ दिन पहले तक थी। मैंने धीरे-धीरे तस्वीरें खींचना बंद कर दी और अपना पूरा ध्यान उसकी यादों से निकलने में लगा दिया।&nbsp;</p><p>पर क्या पुरानी यादों को भुलाना इतना आसान है। उसका वह चेहरा जिसको बयान करने में हर विशेषण फीका है, उसे मन भी न भूल पाने पर विवश था। मैंने उसकी वो हवा में उड़ते किसी दुपट्टे जैसी थी। एकदम बेबाक, और उसकी हंसी तो ऐसी निश्छल जैसे बहता हुआ पानी। उसे छूकर जाने वाली हवाएं खुशबू से भर जाती थी। ऐसा ही कोई खुशबू भरा झोंका उसको छूते हुए पहुंचा था मेरे पास। और मैं खींचा चला गया था उसकी तरफ। खैर श्रेया अपने कॉलेज के नए दोस्तों के साथ कुल्लू यात्रा से वापस हो रही थी। चूँकि बनारस लौटने का रास्ता दिल्ली से होकर गुज़रता था, मैंने उससे दिल्ली में एक मुलाक़ात की अर्ज़ी डाल दी। उसने भी हामी भरकर कहा कि \"मुझे द्वारका मेट्रो से रिसीव कर लेना ना।\" शायद रोज़ मस्ती करने वाले हम दोस्त बीते सालों में काफ़ी गंभीर हो चुके थे। उसकी आवाज में वह मासूमियत नहीं झलकी जिसका मैं कायल था।</p><p>अगली शाम उसकी पसंदीदा नीली रंग की कमीज पहन कर मैं समय से पहले ही मेट्रो पहुंच गया था। एक पास ही के छोटे से हॉटल में मैंने उसकी शाम को यादगार बनाने का इंतज़ाम किया था। सबकुछ वैसा ही था जैसा उसे पसंद था। रंग-बिरंगी मोमबत्तियों की मद्धम रौशनी, सुकून और शोर-सराबे से बिल्कुल दूर एक छोटा सा कैफ़े। मन थोड़ी उधेड़बुन में व्यस्त था कि क्या वह मुझसे अब तक नाराज़ होगी? मुझे समझ ही नहीं आ रहा था कि उससे क्या बातें करूँगा। कहने को तो लाखों बातें हैं पर उसके सामने मैं ठिठक के न रह जाऊँ। वक़्त भी काफ़ी बीत गया। उसे तंज मारकर जो मैं चिढ़ाता रहता था, क्या वह मौसम बदल गया होगा? तभी मुझे ख्याल आया कि मैंने तो उससे कुछ पूछा ही नहीं कि उसकी मेट्रो कब तक पहुंचेगी? कहीं वो भीड़ में गुम न जाए। उसे दिल्ली के भीड़-भाड़ की आदत भी तो नहीं थी। उसके दोस्त हैं उसके साथ पर न जाने एक अजीब सी फ़िक्र तो थी ही। मन की गति बहुत ही तीव्र होती है। एक पल में आसमान समेट लेती है और दूसरे ही पल बिल्कुल खाली। इन्ही उधेड़बुन में मैंने उसे कॉल लगा दिया। उसने कॉल नहीं उठाया। क्या पता घूमते फिरते वक़्त का अंदाजा न लगा हो। अब मैं उसे बार-बार कॉल करके परेशान नहीं करना चाहता था। वो जहाँ भी, जो भी कर रही होगी, मेरे इंतजार से ज्यादा ही जरूरी होगा। मैं इंतज़ार करता रहा। रात घनी होती जा रही थी और स्टेशन पर ख़ामोशी पसरती जा रही थी। पिछले चार-पांच घंटो मे मेरे सामने से गुज़री करीब सौ-सवा सौ मेट्रो मे मैं उसे तीन-चार सौ बार देख चुका था। मेरा भ्रम मेरे दिमाग पर हावी होता जा रहा था। मैं अपने मन में स्कूल की खोयी यादों के बिखरे आशियाने इकट्ठे कर रहा था।</p><p>प्यार की खूबसूरती और अहमियत दोनों ही प्यार की गैरमौजूदगी में ज्यादा बेहतर पता लगती है। तब हर दर्द का बस एक ही नाम होता है। एक ही वजह होती है, याद। दिन ढलते ही दिल भारी सा होने लगता है और रातें एक अजीब सा चुभता हुआ अकेलापन लिए हमें खुद में समेट लेना चाहती है। चारों तरफ उस एक चेहरे को ढूँढती हमारी आँखे किसी के पूछ भर लेने से छलक जाती है। इतने सालों बाद भी मेरा मन फिर से मुझे उसी मुकाम पर ले आया था जहाँ सिर्फ काँटों से बिछे मंज़र मेरे दिल के अनंत टुकड़े किए जा रहे थे। रात और अंधेरी होती जा रही थी और उसके साथ ही मेरा दिल भी। मैं क्यों मिलने को बेचैन हुआ जा रहा हूँ? अचानक से मन में उठते एक सवाल ने मुझसे पूछा। वह खुद गई थी न उसे बीच सफर में छोड़कर। अगर प्यार नहीं भी था तो क्या मुझे एक शब्द में मना नहीं कर सकती थी। यूँ तन्हा छोड़ जाने का क्या मतलब हुआ? उसने एक पल को भी कहाँ सोचा था मेरे बारे में। उसने सिर्फ और सिर्फ अपने बारे में सोचा था। उसने एक बार भी नहीं सोचा कि वह लड़का जो उसके छू लेने भर से कांप जाता है, उसके देख लेने भर से जिसकी आँखें डबडबा जाती है, वह कैसे जी पाएगा उसके बिना। इस भागती-दौड़ती जिंदगी में कोई हमारा हाथ थाम ले तो कितना आसान, कितना जायज़ सा लगने लगता है। आँखों में चमकते किसी के प्यार की रौशनी, होठों पर खिलखिलाता किसी का नाम, जैसे हर चीज को मायने मिल जाते हैं। किसी का साथ हो तो जीवन के ऊबड़खाबड़ सड़कों पर चलना भी ऐसा लगता है कि जैसे हर तरफ बस फूल हीं फूल बिखरे हों। उसका साथ ही तो चाहता था न मैं। बस उसका साथ। दिल सिर्फ अपनी तसल्ली के लिए पेड़ों पर सज रहे सुन्दर फूलों को उचक के तोड़ लेना चाहता है। उसकी खुशबू को अपनी सांसों में भरता है। उसे अपने कमरे के गुलदस्ते में सजाता है और फिर कितनी आसानी से उसे परे सरका देता है। शायद उसने भी यही किया था मेरे साथ।</p><p>अब और इंतज़ार संभव नहीं था। अचानक से मेरे सब्र का बान टूट गया और मैंने उसे फिर से कॉल लगा दिया। उसकी आवाज़ सुन कर मेरी जान मे जान आई की वह सही सलामत है। मैंने हड़बड़ाते हुए उससे पूछा कि ठीक तो हो न तुम और उसने बड़े बेबाकी से जवाब दिया कि \"हाँ अमन! मुझे क्या होगा?\" मैंने पूछा की तुम अभी तक आई नहीं। उसके दिए जवाब से मेरा प्यार हार गया। इतना ज़्यादा की इतना तो मैं फिर भी नहीं टूटा था जब वो मुझे सात साल पहले छोड़ के गई थी। उसे हमारा मिलना याद हीं नहीं था और वह बनारस मेल में बैठ कर यात्रा के अगले पड़ाव में प्रवेश भी कर चुकी थी। हमारे धोखे हमेशा धोखे बने रहें तो कितना अच्छा हो ना। कल को सच खुलने पर सब बिखरता हुआ, सब एकदम खाली सा तो न दिखाई दे। उस एक पल में मन जगजीत सिंह जी के गज़लों से ज़्यादा ग़मगीन हो गया। \"कोई बात नहीं श्रेया। दिन भर घूमने फिरने के थकान में भूल गई होगी।\" उसे यह सब कहते-कहते मेरा गला भर्रा गया। सब रुक गया था मेरे अंदर.. एकदम सन्नाटा.. कोई भी आवाज़ नहीं थी। उसके कहे हुए शब्द अब भी वहीं तैर रहे थे। \"मुझे हमारा मिलना याद नहीं रहा अमन…प्लीज़ मुझे माफ़ कर देना। अगली बार पक्का मिलेंगे।\"</p><p>कुछ पल के सन्नाटे के बाद ये एहसास हुआ की उन सौ-सवा सौ मेट्रो मे जो मुझे चार-पांच सौ बार उसके होने का भ्रम हुआ था, उनमे कोई एक भ्रम वो हकीकत था जिसका अनंत परिदृष्यों में साकार हो पाना संभव न था। वह मेरा अधूरा अनंत बनकर रह गई थी।</p>",

You have to figure out what works best for you, and what you enjoy doing in the end.\" - Sanyam Bhutani</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>In an open conversation with DTU Times during Invictus '23, Ramit Sawhney, Engineering Manager, TRC and Sanyam Bhutani, Senior Data Analyst, H20.AI confessed about their entrepreneurial endeavours, coding hacks and upgrowing startup culture in India.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How much, according to you, should a student focus on data structures and algorithms as it is a constant dilemma amongst students?</strong></p><p>(Ramit Sawhney) Being from Tower Research, and in the case of every big tech company, whether you like it or not you will have to do DSA. It is better to get accustomed to it at an earlier stage. Maybe it changes in the future, but this year and the next year, there will come a time when every company will have a negative filter which will be the HackerRank test on DSA. So I think if you are looking for an internship or a job you need to focus on that DSA bit. Web Development is an additional great thing to have unless you are going for a niche in that.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sanyam Bhutani) I have a very different opinion on it. I have never done DSA and never prepared for it. I’ve done it for the college course but I didn’t do it after that. In my experience startups are generally open to it. I work at H2O.ai and for Kaggle Grandmaster, these are a few achievements for which you really don’t have to do DSA. But, if you eventually want to work at a large scale company, there is no shortcut to it because that’s the only way they know how to hire effectively and they are looking at fifty thousand people every month, every day. You can’t find a way around DSA but if you do, it would be temporary.</p><p>(Ramit Sawhney) I actually spent a lot of time thinking how I can get away from it, from data structures and algorithms or is there any potential that I can get but especially when companies come on campus for students like you and me, like (Sanyam) said there are too many students they have to evaluate so you need to do it. The quicker you accept it, the better it’ll be. It is a filtration process with lots of different students. You need something that everyone knows. It has somehow become the norm now, it has its pros and cons both. Even if you think about Google, I think for the junior level which most of us would be here they only ask about DSA in all the rounds. All DSA rounds and one behavioral round.</p><p><strong>Since you’re a grandmaster in Kaggle, we would like to ask how one can reach that level?</strong></p><p>(Sanyam Bhutani) I started doing DSA and it was out of my own curiosity because I’ve been interviewing Kagglers primarily. I’ve interviewed researchers and practitioners, but I think I’ve done 160 interviews out of which 90 would be Kagglers. And I’ve been asking the same question and I think that there is no way around it except for passion because all the medals of a grandmaster are a proxy of you being passionate about it. Anyone who says it’s easy puts in at least 20,000 hours. It’s a very unglorified effort.</p><p><strong>After college, there are very few people who build a startup and most people go for jobs at other companies. Why do you think that is and how can we promote startup culture?</strong></p><p>(Ramit Sawhney) I will give you my personal experience. When you get into a college, the first thing you hear is that I should do DSA and LeetCode because the internship or placement season is coming. That’s the environment you're looking at, then that is what you will automatically get into. Now, with things like Shark Tank, it is a good example. You see people talking about that. So I don’t think that people are not interested, but for most of us we don’t realize that such a route exists. The common route is to take engineering, get into a good college, and get a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sanyam Bhutani) Since I am a fan of fundamental thinking, I would ask questions like why do you want to have a startup? Do you want to solve a problem, do you want to make money or do you find glory in that? You need to know why you are in it. Even if you are exploring it as a career option you have to have an open mind about your product and what problem it is solving. You have to be clear about your motives.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Since you are an Engineering Manager at Tower Research, could you throw some light at the work culture there?</strong></p><p>(Ramit Sawhney) Work culture is usually a function of your team, your environment and your own mental state. In my case, I never found the work-life balance to be extreme or what sometimes people make it out to be. I personally find the right amount of challenge that keeps me interested but never to the point of burnout. I find it extremely supportive. Bottom line is that it all depends on your mental state.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is one piece of advice that you would give to a first year student who wishes to explore all domains of development?</strong></p><p>(Ramit Sawhney) When you start you think you can do many things, but the biggest strength is in realizing what not to do. Pick one or two things, focus on it, do well in it and then move on to others.</p><p>(Sanyam Bhutani) There is no such defined career path, everyone can do everything. You have to figure out what works best for you, and what you enjoy doing in the end. How you do that could be through random exploration and you can be influenced by people who deliver things differently that gets your attention. You won’t be an expert at anything but explore everything and stick to what you enjoy doing the most.</p>",

Read on as Yash Chaturvedi, 1st Year, MCE, reminds everyone of the ecstasy of travel and the sentiments that we undergo before, during and after the vacation.</strong></i></p><p>Think of films like Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). Apart from being exceptionally directed and being adored by everyone, they share another common aspect- travel. While travelling in a large group of friends or with family, in the breathtaking backdrops of rugged mountains, sandy beaches, the crimson and orange hues of sunsets, blue skies, infinite oceans and shimmering stars at night, I couldn’t help but wonder, what is so special and euphoric about it? Why do we feel the sensation of butterflies scurrying around in our stomach the night before we catch a flight, train or a bus? And most importantly, why do we end up feeling homesick after 3-4 days of the vacation, the one that we so meticulously planned and convinced our parents for?</p><p>When you’re bitten by the Travel Bug, the tingling sensation isn’t felt at the exact moment. It festers and slowly grows as you check off the days on the calendar and prepare yourself for that week or days where you’d be in a different place, breathing different air, seeing different skies and eating new food. It’s almost indescribable, because there are so many things on your mind. Do I take this T-shirt? Are these shorts really necessary for the trip? Will security stop me if I carry this bottle of perfume? Will I actually have fun? You ponder the answers of these questions in your mind as if attempting an exam, and try to make a big deal out of it, while in reality it's not that big of a deal. You end up doing this because you want to experience that rush of emotions, the thrill of packing more than you should and the chaos in the morning while getting ready to leave. Planning the itinerary for the day that lies ahead, quarrelling with your family to go to your dream tourist site, everything seems surreal at that moment. The moment where all you can think about is the joy that you will experience and the memories you will make.&nbsp;</p><p>So you’ve reached your destination. After a tiring journey filled with laughter, short naps, munching on chips and biscuits, you’ve finally made it. You step out and breathe in the air with closed eyes, the breeze going over every feature of your face, sunlight spreading itself into every curve of your body, you feel elated and relaxed. Say you’re at the beach, the waves of the ocean immersing themselves in the crevices of your feet, the coarse sand pinching your toes, the seashells lying bare with wet sand in them, the unseen horizon reaching tending to infinity, the curves of the sun reflecting themselves on the water, the cries of people running around, sipping on fresh coconut water and chewing on pineapple. All of a sudden, you’re being twirled around on the pretzeled roads of the mountains. The growing feeling of nausea takes over, so you look out the window and are beheld by nature’s beauty. The trees covering the mountains, with colourful tiny houses filling in the gaps, the fresh air and mist wetting your face as you hug yourself in the rising gelidity. Now you’re in the forest, covered by the canopy of the trees, strolling in their magnificence, the air condensing on your arms, the palpable smell of the humidity and walking on the muddy trail.&nbsp;</p><p>Unexpectedly, you’re lolling on the cosiest hotel bed, with a cup of coffee in your hand, with the smell of brand new bedsheets and curtains reminding you of your solitude away from work. The sheer joy that you derive from being able to jump around the room, using new products and ordering room service is inexplicable. You look out the giant window and see the city in its glory and beauty, or look out the door to see the empty corridor and close it immediately. All these experiences are real and one deserves to live through them. In simple terms, it brings you bliss. As you smile cheek to cheek lying on your bed with your arms spread out, it is just unfiltered happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>Your trip is coming to an end. Unfortunately, you are packing up the deliberate mess you’ve created and you’re thinking backwards. Thinking about your first day, how you tried to explore everything in the first day, how 24 hours felt less as the trip progressed. Then you proceed to remember your second day, a more calm and relaxed attitude, reserving energy for the night that lies ahead, eating more and more. You pack up the souvenirs you bought for your friends and family, and picture their reactions in your mind. You stuff the dirty clothes and socks in a bag and push them as if they don’t deserve to be in your suitcase. While shutting the door, you realise that all those days, months or even years planning that memorable experience was all worth it in the end.&nbsp;</p>",

There is a constant dilemma in the students on how to balance them well because when someone enters the job, they have to excel more in Development than in DSA. What would be your advice regarding this.</strong></p><p>If you are planning to get into the FAANG companies, one must start early. Don’t start your preparation just before the placement starts. Start preparing from first year itself, practicing 20-30 min a day, so by the time you reach your 3rd year, you are already habitual and good with it. You can enjoy what you do. Of course, it is going to take a lot of effort but you can start a revolution to change the system and the process. If you might have noticed, Google used to give puzzles in their interviews. Eventually, people started speaking up and then Google realised and admitted that their way of interviewing people is wrong. So, if something is wrong, it takes a collective group of people to change it. But again, it takes a long time to bring about a change like that. So, if the big companies are your target, just make the process enjoyable for yourself. But most startups don’t have DSA rounds at all. They will generally provide you with a problem statement and a week’s time to solve the problem.</p><p><strong>As we all know, you are a Grandmaster at Kaggle, which requires 5 competition medals including 1 solo medal, 15 medals for notebooks and other requirements. How can one plan to go about and be a Grandmaster?</strong></p><p>Kaggle is all about doing it religiously and with persistence over a period of time. If you are religiously putting 2 hours every day, then you can reach the level of master or grandmaster in a period of 6-8 months. Doing it the right way and teaming up with a lot of people who have been Kaggling for long helps you learn tricks and can shorten the time even further. If you have good programming skills and a very good GPU, you could easily achieve this goal in 6-8 months. Majority of the problems are NLP and Computer Vision problems; so, if you have access to a good GPU which may be provided by your university, you can crack it if you work diligently.</p><p><strong>In engineering colleges, most of the fresh graduates look to bag jobs in big tech companies and very few of the students plan to start a company of their own. Why do you think this is prevalent in the Indian youth especially? Also, what can be a good way to promote the startup culture among the students?</strong></p><p>Firstly, there’s a pressure to follow all what your peers are doing. Even if someone is passionate &nbsp; about a startup, the thought that their friends are placed in companies such as the MAANG while they are still struggling with their own company can be something that keeps them from pursuing it. Some people might also want to try working in a company for 3-4 years and learn the trade. They still don’t know how the corporate world and the entire end to end things works before going for a company of their own. There’s also a lot of risk involved while starting a company; the market, the unsurety of having funding or not; it’s not rosy for all of them. Other circumstances such as family dependency and other issues may also come into play.</p><p>What I would like to add is that there are a lot of companies and organisations which are coming up with programs for student entrepreneurs. Since there’s a lot of risk involved, one must watch out for these programs. One such program is by Google itself. They had a mentorship program in 3-4 cities and chose a total of 60 entrepreneurs, gave them initial level of funding, access to all the resources.&nbsp;</p><p>As students you can look through these programs as a lot less skin is involved. They gave you a glimpse into the world of startup, free access to mentorship, free access to cloud resources and top researchers. All of these programs run by various companies can be very beneficial for budding entrepreneurs.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i>\"Go for it only if you are passionate about it, or else you won't find the passion and strength to go and work. Don’t do it just because everyone is doing it.\"</i></p><p><i>DTU Times interviewed hon'ble panelist of Yuvaan’23, Kanika Vats, Co-Founder of CosIQ. Read along as she shares her insights about entrepreneurship and life.</i></p><p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of building CosIQ?</strong></p><p>I was working in manufacturing units for a cluster of brands and at that point of time I realized that there were not many regulations for skin care products in India and people were writing anything and everything on their product labels. So, I thought there was a requirement for a brand which was transparent and worked on the skin as well, and that was when this idea came into picture.</p><p><strong>How does CosIQ compete with giants like DermaCo and Minimalist and how are you able to differentiate yourselves?</strong></p><p>They are there in the market, and they are doing really well for themselves. We are not copying an international brand; we believe in using minimum ingredients but maximum active ingredients, you can see on our labels that our Vitamin C serums have only 2 ingredients and our retinols have only 4 ingredients, we believe in using active ingredients, we shouldn’t put something on our skin which isn’t needed, in fact, we were the first ones to launch sunscreen in the form of a serum; we are also really transparent with our customers; we include whatever we write on our labels in the said quantity.</p><p><strong>What is your day-to-day process of learning new things and growing?</strong></p><p>We need to be updated about the new chemicals working out in the market. We read a lot, and we study a lot of technologies, for example- the encapsulation technique. Our sunscreen is double encapsulated, it doesn’t seep into your skin. Sunscreen can cause cancer if it seeps into your skin.</p><p><strong>What was the lowest point in your journey and how did you bounce back from it?</strong></p><p>The lowest point was when we started CosIQ. It was June 2021. We had gone all in, and at one point of time we were unable to pay our EMIs as well, so that was when we had hit rock-bottom, the bank also took our car away, but that’s the part and parcel of life, you have highs and lows, the very next day we got a call from Shark Tank, so it's good that our car was taken away. (Laughs)</p><p>Things changed after that. We were on national television, and it was like an eureka moment for CosIQ. That was when we started to grow, and people loved our products. We have been able to create a community of customers because we don’t push sales; we pull sales, and we want our customers to keep coming back to us.</p><p><strong>What has been the biggest change in your life post Shark Tank?</strong></p><p>People started to recognize us and our brand, and we saw a massive spike in our sales, we also went out of stock initially due to Shark Tank, which is a very nice feeling, but we were also losing out on orders because we were sold out. We were out of stock for 3 months because we had forecasted our sales incorrectly, but it was a learning opportunity since it came at an early stage, and we are doing really well now.</p><p><strong>At times, women entrepreneurs aren't taken very seriously, did you face any discrimination solely because you are a woman?</strong></p><p>No, I wouldn’t really say that. See difficulties are there in life at every point, but it all depends on how you move ahead with it. In fact, I don’t understand this woman-entrepreneur term. An entrepreneur is an entrepreneur. This segmentation is similar to the caste system that we have in our society. We live in a patriarchal society, so some people don’t take you seriously unless there is a man standing next to you. I remember an employee not taking me seriously due to his male-ego.</p><p><strong>What is the one advice that you would give to budding entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>Go for it only if you are passionate about it, or else you won't find the passion and strength to go and work. Don’t do it just because everyone is doing it.&nbsp;</p>",

If you are passionate, you would want to work every day.\" DTU Times interviewed Geetika Gupta, Co-founder &amp; Chief Pilot at MOPP Foods during Yuvaan.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>What all changed for your brand after your Shark Tank episode telecasted?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The most important impact was the sales. Our sales shot up in just a matter of seconds, and while the episode was being telecasted, our phones did not stop beeping. Our brand is hyper-local, but we received calls from various parts of India. The visibility that Shark Tank gives your brand is amazing. Our brand became popular instantly. Our sales increased by 60% and we got more than 100 calls for franchise opportunities from various parts of the world, even outside India.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the steps you follow for constant growth and learning?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Know your business! By knowing your business, you will find ways to learn. There are a lot of books, interviews and media available online which can help you to grow. But knowing your business, analysing and reading feedback will give you a lot of insight into your business, which you cannot gain from an external source. I believe in learning from everyone and everything, not just from books or the Internet. If you have an open mind, you can take everything as a learning opportunity. Try to learn something from whatever you do on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>What was the lowest moment in your journey and what were your learnings from it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Entrepreneurship is like a roller coaster ride. There are highs and lows. There can be moments of happiness, excitement, and sadness. In my journey, I have gone through many stages. The 3Ps that have helped me in my journey are passion, patience and perseverance. I used to go to the mirror and ask myself If I had fulfilled my mission and vision. If you are passionate, you would want to work every day. If you are patient enough to face the ups and downs without giving up, you will eventually achieve success.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the one attribute that college graduates lack, which is required in the industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have interacted with a lot of GenZ. I feel that they lack patience; they want overnight success, and they need to change their attitude and realize that they won't get all the opportunities laid on a silver spoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

    "slug": "interview-hardik-banga-469",
    "body": "<p><strong>How do you come up with ideas for content, and how do you stay motivated to keep creating?</strong></p><p>My content is based on the lives of students and since I am a student myself, my life is my content, so ideas come naturally to me. After building a career from scratch in a span of 2 to 3 years, there is a certain responsibility to maintain that and keep levelling up, so the motivation to do better will always remain there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you balance sharing your personal experiences while maintaining your privacy?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Social media has two sides. One is where you have to be public with everyone, but at the same time, a content influencer has another aspect of their life which they do not wish to showcase so we cannot post everything. So finding that balance and to understand the difference between content is important.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Everyone has stories, but not all stories are interesting. How do you manage to make your stories worth listening to for your users?</strong></p><p>Since I am a 4th year student, I know what students of our age group like to hear and watch. If they don’t appeal to the students, I have to make changes accordingly so that everyone is able to relate to it. So I keep the relatability factor of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your content primarily driven by? Is it focused on content that does well, or does it have more of what you like?</strong></p><p>It’s a mixture of both. Content creation does not solely involve the ideas of the creator, one has to think about what will work with respect to numbers. Since we are doing it on a big level now, I have to consider adding an element to the content that I like, which will eventually work in the long run. So I have to connect the two things in such a manner that my audience and I are both happy in the end.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are your views on content creation being the new face of marketing?</strong></p><p>It definitely is a face of marketing, and it is going to stay for a long time. It will replace a lot of industries, and the competition regarding the same has already increased. One has to stay relevant to continue growing in the business. I ensure that by innovating. If I keep on creating the same content, at one point I have to do something new so that my content remains relatable and I stay relevant. Whether it's inherent or not, I have to bring something new to the table every 3 to 6 months.</p><p><strong>What has been the biggest challenge that you’ve faced while making videos?</strong></p><p>The biggest challenge was retention. In current times, anyone can create content and for most people, it ends up working. But to retain that ability, building a community and ensuring that my followers genuinely know me is one of the major challenges I face till date. Getting views is rather easy, but building a brand is very difficult.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you share how a social media presence has impacted your life, both positively and negatively?</strong></p><p>Mostly it has had a positive impact as it has given me a face for the youth, and to be invited to these events and be felicitated is a great feeling. The negative side remains that there are some things you can’t go public with. One has to keep that phase of their life aside.</p><p><strong>How do you balance your work with life and college?</strong></p><p>I’m still in my 4th year, and I’m sure you all would know the stress that comes with it! Currently, I don’t have a work-life balance as everything is still in a building stage, and things are scattered here and there, but with time everyone will figure it out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are an Instagram content creator, and we currently have this debate going around whether content on Instagram is good quality content. What is your take on that?</strong></p><p>Content on every platform is either good or bad. There is a lot of informative content on Instagram, but at the same time, there is no shortage of cringe content, and both have their separate audiences. I don’t think short-form content is harmful, it all depends on what you watch. Lip-syncing, transitions, comedy and finance are all a part of short-form content, but in the end it totally depends on the consumer. Content is always healthy, it's the algorithm that is unhealthy. It's the platform that causes the addiction.&nbsp;</p>",

Read on as Navya Singh, 1st Year, EE delves into the captivating yet tumultuous world of an \"it girl,\" as she grapples with the toll of fame, beauty standards, and a failed marriage.</strong></i></p><p>A flurry of flashes blinds her as photographers call out her name on the red carpet. She dazzles her trademark smile in return, a scintillating goddess in her own right. She is flogged by producers and actors alike throughout the night of the premiere of her latest movie. She smiles kindly at the praise she receives; how beautiful she looked in the film, and how brilliantly she showcased the complexities of her character.</p><p>Wherever she looks, she finds her own self smiling down at her. Her face adorns the enormous posters placed outside the venue, and the advertisement boards on her way show her holding a bottle of perfume, a box of cream, or a can of soda. Even as she leaves, she hears the cries of photographers and fans alike. Cheeks aching, she finally settles down in her car and winces at the sharp pain in her feet, already turning blue from the awful shoes that simply had to be worn tonight. She brushes her hair out of her face; dyed blonde now. She has often wondered what her mother would think of it, or if she would even recognise her daughter. No, her mother has only ever known a brown-haired full faced<br>girl who loved to play in the mud outside their kitchen. She would not recognise her now, with her straw-like blonde hair and her hollowed cheeks.</p><p>She closes her eyes in a moment of dizziness, caused by starving herself for the past two days so she might fit into the dress she has worn tonight. The suffocating smell of cigarettes lingers in her car, another way to make her face look sharper, her shoulders daintier. She looks out the window to yet again see her face smiling back at her. She wants to claw that serpentine smile off the poster. She does not remember the last time she genuinely smiled, does not know if she is even capable of the act anymore.</p><p><br>She thinks of the ending of the movie she has just seen, how happy and in love the two protagonists seemed. She knows a stack of papers finalising the details of her divorce will be waiting on her office desk when she gets home. She wonders if her husband will wait until the high of her new movie has passed before announcing their separation, or if he would steal her spotlight; simply to spite her.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The car halts to a stop outside her mansion, as she steps out, careful not to grimace in front of her chauffeur. A woman, plain to look at with ashy brown hair and wide-set eyes, walks with her husband. They recognise her immediately- she is used to the widening of eyes, the slight pause in breath when people see her. She smiles at them, as the couple rush to shake hands with her, telling her how they admire her work, how beautiful she is in person. She smiles and thanks them for their kind words, but as she turns to leave she hears the woman whisper to her husband.</p><p><br><i>“Oh, how I wish I could be her.”</i></p><p><br>She smiles sadly to herself as she steps into her house that feels too large, too empty. She<br>whispers to the too-large foyer.</p><p><br><i>“So do I.”</i></p>",

Also, previously as an artist in Haryanvi movies, he describes how he contributed to the promotion of the Haryanvi Culture. Don't miss out on this exclusive interview and gain valuable insights from Mr. Lather's journey.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Bringing ancient and contemporary Haryanvi culture together, the state-level youth festival, ‘Ratnawali’ is celebrated with immense exuberance. Your contributions to its formation and evolution over the years to become what it is today are unsurpassed. We would like to know more about the journey that Ratnawali, formerly known as Haryana Day, has travelled and your experience as the pioneer of the festival.</strong></p><p>As far as Ratnawali is concerned, it all started long ago, in 1985. It started in my mind in 1981, when I got an assignment for a play named ‘Rani Jind’, which was to be in Punjabi while working as a freelancer in theatres after passing out from the Department of Indian Theatre. All the artists in this play were from Punjab, and I was the only non-Punjabi-speaking guy in the whole production. I got the script in Hindi and read it for 2–3 days, and tried speaking the dialogues with not-so-correct pronunciation. So, I asked them to give me a script written in Gurmukhi. After getting the script in Gurmukhi, I bought a Qaida for the Punjabi language and started learning Gurmukhi. Also, I used to spend a lot of time with my Punjabi-speaking friends, like a famous Punjabi poet Amitoj, trying to talk to him in Punjabi and having conversations. As this play was a historical play, and being an inquisitive learner and avid reader, I started spending the rest of my time other than rehearsals in the Punjab University library learning about history during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. I read all the books available in the Punjab University library. I read books available in the Chandigarh Central Library, and at that time I realised nothing was written about Haryana, not even a single page about its culture, dance, or folk. That made an impact on me to start something in Haryana too. We went to the US and gave 75 performances across different cities. A lot of friends asked me to stay in the US, and though it was very easy for me to stay there, I came back to India and started studying the history and culture of Haryana, and during the study, I got to know that the nucleus of any culture is folk theatre because it contains all the aspects of that particular culture like singing, music, dance, humour, etc. Luckily, we had a theatre known as ‘Saang’ in Haryana. Before that, part of my education was at the convent school and at the Sainik School. So, I didn't have exposure to the culture.&nbsp;</p><p>After coming from the US, I followed Ramkishan Vyas for some time, and in the meantime, I made up my mind by observing, learning, and executing. There were two historical reasons for the degradation of Haryanvi folk. One was the revolt of 1857 because people from this region participated in it, and sponsorship was not given to them, so they migrated to other parts of India. Secondly, after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, most of the Haryanavi folk artists were Muslims. So, they migrated to Pakistan. When I realised that we need to work on folk instruments and, for that matter, I applied for the job of Director of Youth and Culture at Kurukshetra University and I got the job. We converted the Haryana Day Evening celebration into Full day celebration and from that time we increased the number of events, subsequently days increased from 1 to 4, and venues increased from 1 to 5.&nbsp;</p><p>I have introduced 30 events as I worked there for 30 years. We wrote to different colleges about this event. Haryana Day was introduced in different colleges of Haryana as a part of their fest. When I was a member of the Cultural Board of the Association of Indian Universities, I gave a presentation to introduce folk instruments to different parts of India to different colleges, as people from tribal areas were also present there. So, for experimentation folk orchestra was introduced in colleges for a year, and now the folk orchestra is an event. Also, we introduced Humour, Poetry, Ghazal, and Haryanavi Pop. I was criticised for introducing Haryanavi Pop. After working on all the aspects, Ratnawali is now so successful. Haryana is the only state in India where Saang is part of the Youth Festival in colleges and schools and that helped us to transfer our folk culture to our younger generation very easily and effectively. Ratnawali has been celebrated every year since 1985 without a single break, which is a great achievement in itself.</p><p><strong>Have you ever faced any difficulty/opposition in introducing women to lead or supporting roles in plays?</strong></p><p>We have to be very cautious while making any kind of change and have to perceive the problem. I will give you an example. We had started the event and a few girls from a college came to participate. There was a tradition that people used to come on stage to give money to artists as a reward. So, when I got this information, I took the mic and announced, “This is the new beginning because for the first time in the history of Haryana, Girls will be participating. So, whoever comes on stage to give money to artists, remember to consider them as my daughter or their sister.” Surprisingly nobody came. So, you need to find easier ways to do the job. Also, I was trying to expand this festival but people were getting anxious because the workload and crowd were increasing. Sometimes people say there will be a total ruckus. Once the VC of Kurukshetra University refused to permit a celebration, so there I raised my voice through the student union.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you find it difficult to make students interested in folk dance/music and theatre?</strong></p><p>I never said that I’m doing it instead I have always said that this is our <i>yaj</i> and we are doing our part of rituals also, I’ve always tried to imbibe one thing in students and that is - they are the saviours and soldiers of folk culture that’s why it is celebrated continuously every year. Sometimes people say who is going to take the responsibility and I have always stood upon to take that responsibility because thousands of people come to visit and enjoy the festival.</p><p><strong>You have acted in a couple of movies. Do you think that the current regional and national cinematic creations are doing justice to the diverse cultural identity in the country?</strong></p><p>The first thing you need for a film is a story to share. If the story interests you, it will also interest of the audience; secondly, the tools and the technologies also play an important role. Different forms of cinema in different regions offer varied experiences and one can find what one wants to see. The choice belongs to the audience and that choice varies as the audience ages. Either you should be able to deliver what the audience wants, or you should have the ability to cultivate the audience for the type of content you desire to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In Bollywood, characters from different states are generally caricatured and are not represented with sincerity. How do you think that can be overcome?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Caricaturing the characters is generally an easy way out. A society contains various kinds of people, so it is not very easy to represent all the minute details. This is a very ticklish subject, keeping things in a generalised manner increases acceptability and business opportunities. Some change is being observed nowadays. Now films do not contain many songs and the OTT platform also has some new types of content to offer, but generally, the new types of content are. heavily inspired by the content available abroad. They generally follow the same pattern and flow of progression of the storyline. We have 4-5 sorts of emotions, and we generally cash in on that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us something about your latest book ‘काल और ताल’ which was launched at the New Delhi World Book Fair, 2023.</strong></p><p>All my life, my main motto has been the preservation, promotion, and documentation of the culture of different states. Nowadays we have been detached from the traditions and cultures of the past. I could feel that as our culture was vanishing, our music was also vanishing, so I went to various villages and started recording the tunes. I made sure to include the notation of the songs alongside so that my future generations could reciprocate the songs in a similar way to the original. It would be like a collection of my heritage. The book contains songs ranging from events of birth to marriage to death. We have a tradition to celebrate the death of people who are close to the age of 100 since they have lived life in its truest sense, I have recorded those songs as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nowadays, families are shifting to urban areas for job opportunities and education. How can we preserve our own culture and preserve that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I feel that in another 30 years, 70 percent of the population will be urbanised. Even the way a normal conversation is carried out in urban areas is different from rural areas. I feel culture is transitional, and the sense of fashion also keeps on changing. These things go around in a circle. We still see traditional, ethnic dresses in fashion shows, movies, and weddings, since these styles have been documented and preserved. However, I would be the last person to stop youngsters from progressing to newer trends. There was a time when I enjoyed listening to The Beatles, then there was also a time when I used to go gaga over Rasputin’s music, so just like a flowing arrow we cannot stop the generation from progressing else they will get diverted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has your journey been over the years in terms of the responsibilities you’ve taken and the challenges you’ve faced?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Presently, I am working as the Chairperson of the Cultural Council and PRO of the University of Delhi. Back in the day, there was a difference. I had to do a lot of things on my own; I had to create my team of youngsters, and I used to conduct training programs for them. When I came to DTU, I realised that I had to generate work and relevancy for myself. I remember being closely involved in organising the EngiFest. I wanted the team over here to grow, and I closely listened to the problems they faced. It's important to have faith in the students when they list their monetary demands for organising the fest. I made sure that the money was being handled and utilised properly, and I saw the grandeur of the fest grow over the years. At DTU, the students have always exceeded my expectations in every regard, unlike the places I've worked in the past. I remember DTU Times being very unorganised when I first came here; we decided to divide the team into various subdivisions. I had done the same during my time at Kurukshetra University during the Ratnawali festival. Gradually we increased the amount and quality of content we were delivering at DTU Times. DTU gives you an opportunity to rediscover yourself. I know about many such students who have ventured into various diverse fields since the students over here have a lot of potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",

It’s a beautiful confluence which has been conspired to be.\"</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Aditi Bhutia Madan, Founder of BluePine Foods and Yangkiez, Opener Shark Tank Season 1, MasterChef India Season 3 Top 6, during Yuvaan. Read on as she shares her highly inspiring entrepreneurial journey and talks about the joy of popularly being called the \"Momo Mami\".</strong></i></p><p><strong>How does it feel to become a household name in India?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being crowned Momo Mami is a validation that my journey, vision, and purpose are on the right path. As someone from the Himalayas, I understand the importance of authenticity and handcrafted momos made with love, care, healthy, and hygienic ingredients. It's a validation from the right person that we're able to create awareness and deliver authentic momos to our customers. Handcrafted momos generate opportunities for the unprivileged, including single mothers, divorced, and orphans. This journey from MasterChef to SharkTank has been amazing, and I'm grateful for the beautiful confluence that brought us here. To anyone selling momos, my message is to make them handcrafted with love and care, and the right ingredients.</p><p><strong>Do you think being a male would help you better?</strong></p><p>As a female entrepreneur, I believe my brand and product are best suited to me. If a male were in my position, it would be more difficult and unjust as women put more love and care into everything. Just as mothers and sisters prepare food with good intentions and nutrients, I want to pass on that same thought and feeling to my employees, making momos with love and care.</p><p><strong>What did you learn during your Masterchef journey?</strong></p><p>MasterChef taught me that food should be prepared with love and care, rather than complicated dishes with layers of cooking that look fancy but are not healthy. Innovation in food should bring something new while keeping it simple. Basic and simple foods are now more valuable as people are going back to their roots and rediscovering sustainable clothing, pottery, and locally available ingredients like millet and ragi. However, I am concerned that these once thought of as poor man's foods are becoming a rich man's diet, leaving the poor behind. MasterChef has taught me the value of basic cooking techniques and using locally available resources.</p><p><strong>What are the most influential people that you have come across in your career and how have they inspired you?</strong></p><p>I draw inspiration from a variety of people, including actors like Akshay Kumar, who exemplifies discipline and a balanced lifestyle. His boundless energy is infectious. Another source of inspiration for me is chef Vikas Khanna, who has taken Indian cuisine to the world and was one of the first Michelin star chefs. I'm proud to have contributed to the journey of bringing momos to the country in a way that values and respects the cuisine. My husband has also been a significant inspiration. He has taught me to respect all cultures, and his guidance has been invaluable to me in times of confusion. Additionally, my IIM Ahmedabad professor Sunil Handa has been a mentor to me in business. He is a humble, grounded, and supportive guide for entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on food wastage as an entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>Blue Pine's core purpose is to reduce agro-produce wastage by converting it into products that have a longer shelf life. As a farmer's daughter-in-law, I understand the effects of agro-produce waste, pesticide use, and climate change on crop growth. Startups and entrepreneurs must take action to find solutions to prevent food shortages. We should also consume food responsibly and avoid overeating. I do not support meat replacement products, which can bring more diseases. We must generate awareness among our parents and communities to prevent wastage of agro-produce. Fashion food should be avoided, as it destroys a lot of agro-produce and grains. Instead, we should consume natural food from the soil. We must act now to correct our actions and prevent future food shortages.</p><p><strong>What would you say to a momo lover?</strong></p><p>Please have Yangkiez momos by Momo Mami! I'm associated with GoldenEye as a jury from where we try to give more opportunities to blind people. They actually do amazing cooking. So by having Yangkiez momos, you’re supporting the cause and venture of their employees.</p>",

But for us, it’s about what you do that makes you beautiful.\"</strong></i><br><br><i><strong>In an open conversation with DTU Times during Invictus'23, Varun Alagh, Co-founder and CEO of Mamaearth delves into the compelling origins of Mamaearth, driven by the vision to provide toxin-free products.</strong></i><br><br><i><strong>Read on as he unveils their successful expansion into the beauty industry, along with the powerful message that skincare is essential for all individuals, transcending gender norms.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How does it feel to be back on campus after so long?</strong></p><p>It feels fantastic. This is where I started my professional learning path. Coming back to space and watching it expand so much is incredible. The infrastructure is substantially better and larger from what we had to what you have. The enthusiasm and passion that we had to make a difference will help you develop a name for your college. We were the first group to construct the racing car that was chosen. Other things were going on at the time. The desire for building something new and developing something new, which puts your name and the college's name on the map, is still present and, you know, similarly high. But I'm overjoyed to be here.</p><p><br><strong>What was the idea behind MamaEarth? And who do you aim to target with this product? What were the turning points in your journey?</strong></p><p>The idea started with our own son. We couldn't find the right chemical-free natural products for him, which pained us to order stuff from the USA or UK. Asking relatives to bring in was always a hassle. Just telling them, <i>\"Please, ye le ana, wo le ana,\"</i> it's just painful. Because not everyone is willing to adjust to those requests that you have. Right. And you're already so stressed as a parent that these things make you feel here. I wish there was a better way. And that inspired us to think, can this be done in India? And when we started researching, when we started thinking is when we realized that, yes, it was possible. It needed someone to take that mantle and do something about it, which is what we then started doing. We quit our jobs and started working on building a brand that will stand for toxin-free, clean, labeled natural products and build that for India because Indians deserve better personal care. And that's how we started, and here's where we are.</p><p>Starting your journey is the most crucial turning point that we can all make. Along the path, I experienced a lot of ups and downs, which you must manage. Thank goodness for my wife, co-founder, and some Black Label. We put in the effort. Things will improve the next day, you know. Having adult categories, having a celebrity on board, taking capital at the proper time, and acting aggressively while everyone else was passive during Covid-19. All of that has been inflecting points.</p><p><strong>At what point did you realize that your product can cater to adults who want more toxin-free products?</strong></p><p>Yeah. Finally, keeping your focus on the consumer is beneficial. Finally, they keep telling you what they require; if you keep reading that, your path keeps forming. So we just kept listening to our customers because kids don't buy items directly; their parents do. They assured us that we, too, would like to have stuff for ourselves. This is something with which we can identify. So when we heard that, we started concept testing and asked them if they would be interested in launching anything similar. And the response was emphatic yes. As a result, we began with a tiny project. We started in hair care with something in the hair fall area because our mums were buying us. And that received a very great response. And with that, we didn't stop. We continued to grow and to listen.</p><p><strong>Within marketing, how do you differentiate yourself from a brand like Johnson's and Johnson's, which has been there since our childhood?</strong></p><p>The largest difference for us was, first and foremost, functional, that we were toxin free rather than just stating it, but claiming it yourself will not win people's faith. We needed someone impartial and external to back it up for us. Right. That is why we tested with MadeSafe and received certification as Asia's first Made Safe certified brand. And that merely added to its popularity among consumers. This is a Certified Safe brand that helps us break through with customers. This is what makes this unique. Then, emotionally, we were always concerned with internal sustainability and virtue. When you order a product from our website, you will plant a tree, and the geolocation of the tree will be displayed. The picture of that tree makes you believe that you're not just doing good for yourself by choosing the natural product, but also for your Earth and your community. And the blend of emotional and utilitarian helps us differentiate.</p><p><strong>Do you think becoming plastic-positive is a real goal for many people, or do people do it more as a publicity stunt?</strong></p><p>That depends on the organization. For some, it is a CSR agenda. For others, it is a firm belief that as part of establishing your company's brand, this is how you will differentiate. It is a component of our brand building and part of how the company lives. So there isn't just one agenda. So far, we have recycled almost 3000 metric tonnes of plastic, which continues to climb as we grow older.</p><p>Similarly, we have a “Water For All” campaign on our other brands, such as Aqua Logica. We have a little scientist program, Dermaco. As a result, each brand has its own program that relates to life and how it contributes to society. Because we send you a message with a community where we put a water plant and you can see the family who got clean water. As a result, you actually get to witness this whole thing come to life. So it is a way of life for us, which is the major distinction between us and others.</p><p><strong>Is it something small brands can aim to do as well?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We, of course, began it. When you're young, it's not so much about your size as your intent. Even if we ignore the brand component, what you believe in as an individual is the most important. We recycled more plastic than we anticipated. That philosophy may also be applied to individuals. To seek more.</p><p><strong>Are your products something that can expand into the beauty industry as well? For people more focused on their looks?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sure, of course. We just got into color cosmetics last year. So we now have lipsticks and foundations. Everything, right? Liquid lipsticks, concealers, kajals, you name it. And they are all certified to be safe. Toxin-free in the end, they're doing amazingly well because people are obviously seeking solutions where even in Beauty, which gets put the whole day on your face, on your lips, you want something that's not poisonous and that's hazardous chemical free, and yeah, we're getting there. We see a lot of bright futures in that field in the long run.</p><p><strong>What is your concept of “beauty” as a natural product brand?</strong></p><p>For us, beauty is not a noun. It's a verb. And that's the biggest difference, right? Beauty for a lot of companies has been about how you look. But for us, it's about what you do that makes you beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Students, especially males, don't focus on skincare, thinking it's feminine. How can they be convinced to focus on skincare too?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is an ever-changing sector—can you believe toothpaste didn't exist until 70 years ago? We can't imagine now that it's a necessary aspect of basic hygiene. Similar to sunscreen, evolution, cultural, and behavioral changes will eventually occur.</p>",

रोने के लिए ज़िन्दगी बहुत छोटी है”</strong></p><p><i><strong>डी•टी•यू&nbsp; टाइम्स के द्वारा साहित्य एवं फिल्म समारोह ‘युवान’ के अवसर पर मशहूर कॉमेडियन रजत चौहान का साक्षात्कार लिया गया । साक्षात्कार में रजत चौहान से वीडियो रील्स, यूट्यूब एवं वतर्मान समय में&nbsp; कलाकारों पर हो रहे मुकदमों इत्यादि जैसे विषयों पर वार्ता हुई |&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>क्या आप अपने लाइव शो के दौरान हुए किसी अनोखे किस्से को हमारे संस्करण के माध्यम से साझा करना चाहते हैं?</strong></p><p>मेरे हिसाब से हर शो कुछ न कुछ नया सिखाकर ही जाता है। मेरी यह ख़ास आदत है कि मैं छोटी-बड़ी चीज़ों पर बारीकी से गौर करने में यकीन रखता हूँ। मैं आज भी अपने नए-नए प्रयोगों से सीख ही रहा हूँ। चाहे वह कोई भी शो हो - कॉर्पोरेट शो, कॉलेज शो या अन्य छोटे-बड़े प्रदर्शन, हरेक अवसर खुद में विशेष है और उन सभी का अपना एक मज़ा है। हर जगह कुछ न कुछ नया सीख ही रहे हैं। अब आप पूछेंगे कि क्या नया सीख रहा हूँ, तो मेरा जवाब होगा कि अगर बड़ा थिएटर शो कर रहा होता हूँ तो कॉमेडी के साथ साथ थोड़ी एक्टिंग भी करनी होती है और अगर बड़े रूम के बाद कभी छोटे रूम में परफॉर्म कर रहे होते हैं तो लगता है कि “मैं इतना चिल्ला क्यों रहा हूँ?” (हास्यास्पद)</p><p>कुछ चंद लम्हों पहले ही मेरे सामने गिनती के लोग थे और अकस्मात दर्शकों की भीड़, जिस भीड़ को देखकर मैं आज भी पसीज जाता हूँ। दोनों स्थितियों की तैयारी पूर्णतः भिन्न है। कभी-कभार तो शो ख़तम होने के बाद एहसास होता है कि कितनी सारी चीज़ें तो मेरी योजना में भी नहीं थी। ये सब चीज़ें मेरे जीवन का अभिन्न अंग बन चुकी हैं।</p><p><strong>कॉमेडियन के रूप में आप अलग-अलग मंचों पर प्रदर्शन करते हैं, परिणामस्वरूप आपके शो कि छोटी-बड़ी वीडियो रील्स एवं यूट्यूब के माध्यम से आपके चैनल पर उपलब्ध है। आप इन दोनों प्रारूपों में से किसे अधिक तवज्जो देते हैं?</strong></p><p>मेरे विचार से स्टैंड-अप एक लम्बे समय का प्रारूप है। रील्स एक तरह का फ़ास्ट फ़ूड है जो लोगों को कुछ सीमित पल के लिए आनंदित तो कर सकता है परन्तु अंत में एक लम्बा प्रारूप ही किसी विशेष के मन को जीतने की एकमात्र प्रक्रिया है। मैं पॉडकास्ट का बहुत बड़ा प्रसंशक हूँ। मुझे नहीं पता कि इस उभरते विधा में आप लोग ज़्यादा रूचि रखते हैं या नहीं परन्तु मेरे विचार से पंद्रह सेकेंड में किसी कथन से मन पर गहरा असर नहीं डाला जा सकता। मुझे नहीं लगता कि इतने कम लम्हों में मैं किसी का मनोरंजन कर सकता हूँ। मेरे हिसाब से यूट्यूब एक लम्बा प्रारूप है और मेरी कोशिश है कि मैं उस पर रहते हुए ही आपको ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा हँसा सकूँ।</p><p><strong>क्या आपको लगता है की रील्स वगैरह एक आर्ट फॉर्म की तरह माने जा सकते हैं?</strong></p><p>मुझे तो लगता है कि काफ़ी लोग इसे पहले से ही एक आर्ट फॉर्म मान चुके हैं। कुछ लोग पंद्रह सेकेंड में अपनी बात कह सकते हैं जिनके लिए यह फॉर्मेट एक वरदान की तरह है। वास्तव में स्टैंड-अप का उद्देश्य लोगों को हँसाना है चाहे वह छोटे-बड़े किसी भी प्रारूप के माध्यम से संभव हो। मेरी कोशिश होती है कि मैं उन सभी लोगों की आवाज़ बन सकूँ जो अपने मन की बात सहजता से नहीं बोल पाते। जैसे आप रील्स साझा करते हैं तो इसका कारण यही है न कि वह आपको आपके दोस्तों से जोड़ती हैं । ख़राब रील्स और भी ज़्यादा वायरल होती है क्योंकि लोग अपना समय बर्बाद होता देखकर दूसरों का समय भी बर्बाद कर देना चाहते हैं। (हास्य)</p><p>सकारात्मकता यही है कि सौभाग्य से सभी के घर में आज स्मार्टफोन है जिसके परिणामस्वरूप आज हर दूसरे घर में क्रिएटर है जो पंद्रह बीस-सेकेंड में अलग-अलग प्लेटफार्म से पैसे कमा पा रहा है।</p><p><strong>आपके हिसाब से क्या आज के दौर में रील्स बनाना कॉमेडियन्स के गुणों को प्रदर्शित करने का सही माध्यम है या नहीं?</strong></p><p>मेरे अनुसार, जो दिखता है, वही बिकता है। जिसके पास क्षमता होगी, उसे पहचान मिलने से कोई नहीं रोक सकता। अगर आपका काम सही है तो लोग आपको देखना पसंद करेंगे, अन्यथा नहीं। घूम फिरकर बात यही है कि चाहे वीडियो बनाने के बहुत से प्रारूप हो, प्रमुख यह है कि लोगों को वह पसंद आ रहे हैं या नहीं। अंततः आपको एक शानदार अनुभव ही पसंद होगा। शायद आपको मेरी दस मिनट की वीडियो देखने का समय न हो तो आप उस समय पर उसे देखना पसंद नहीं करेंगे। आपको यह एहसास होगा कि मैं अभी पंद्रह सेकेंड का क्विक-बाइट लेने के लिए ज्यादा तैयार हूँ, इसलिए मैं अभी वही देख लेता हूँ। इसका एक नुकसान यह भी हुआ है कि आपकी ध्यान अवधि काफी कम हो चुकी है। अब लोग बहुत जल्दी चीजों से ऊबने लगे हैं। उन्हें कुछ पल का समय भी अब बहुत अधिक जान पड़ता है। अब मैं तो इस इंडस्ट्री से आता हूँ इसलिए मुझे खबर है कि रील्स जैसे छोटे फॉर्मेट में भी क्वालिटी सबसे ज़रूरी होती है। पंद्रह सेकेंड के क्लिप के लिए भी कितने ही बहुतेरे एंगल शिफ्ट लेने पड़ते हैं ताकि आप किसी दूसरी वीडियो पर जल्दी स्वाइप न कर सके।</p><p><strong>आप बहुत से प्रोजेक्ट्स में व्यस्त रहते हैं, जैसे इंडिया टूर, ऑफिस टूर, मिनी शो आदि। इस क्रम में आप लगातार अलग-अलग कंटेंट बनाने को मजबूर हैं। समय के साथ-साथ, जब आपकी लोकप्रियता इतनी बढ़ चुकी है, तो अपनी कॉमेडी के कुछ मुख्य तत्वों को हर एक लाइव शो में शामिल करना कितना मुश्किल हो जाता है?</strong></p><p>भाई मुश्किल तो है पर यही मेरा काम है, मेरी रोज़ी-रोटी है। पहले बहुत परेशानी होती थी पर अब आदत हो चुकी है। इस क्षेत्र में शुरुआत में तो काफी समय तक कुछ समझ नहीं आता था। स्टैंड-अप का प्रारूप भी नया था, इसलिए कुछ समय तो पैर जमाने में लग गए पर मैंने धैर्य का साथ कभी नहीं छोड़ा और आगे बढ़ता गया। अगर आपके मन में किसी उद्देश्य के प्रति सच्ची लगन और पूर्ण आत्मविश्वास है तो आप असंभव प्रतीत होने वाली कठिनाइयों से भी जूझ सकते हैं। आपके भी कुछ लक्ष्य होंगे जैसे कि किसी को एक अच्छा व्यवसाय करना होगा या किसी को विदेश में पढ़ाई करनी होगी। उसी प्रकार मेरा भी लोगों को हँसाने का एक छोटा सा उद्देश्य था जिसमें शायद मैं सक्षम रहा हूँ। आप कभी भी किसी कला में पूरी तरह से निपुण नहीं हो सकते, समय आपको कुछ न कुछ सिखाता ही रहताहै। अगर मैं मानूँ कि मुझे वीडियो<strong> </strong>बनाते हुए पाँच साल हो गए हैं तो शायद उस समय आप स्कूल में थे। अगर मैं स्कूल के समय से आजतक आप सब के मनोरंजन का साधन रहा हूँ तो वास्तव में यह मेरे लिए बड़ी उपलब्धि है क्योंकि आपके बड़े होने के साथ-साथ मैं भी अनुभवी होता रहा हूँ। हमारे स्कूल में उद्देश्य अलग होते है जैसे कि दोस्त बनाना, परीक्षा में अच्छे अंक लाना इत्यादि पर जीवन इतना सुगम नहीं है। हर समय मुश्किलों से सामना करना और उनसे सीखना ही इसे मनोरंजक बनाए रखता है। आपको ज़्यादा परेशान होकर जीवन को भार नहीं बनाना है। प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियों के अनुभव से स्वयं को नई सीख देते रहना ही मेरे हिसाब से सबसे ज़रूरी है और हमें बस इसका ख़्याल रखते हुए आगे बढ़ते रहना चाहिए।</p><p><strong>आप अपने शो में क्लीन कॉमेडी पर ज्यादा ध्यान देते हैं जबकि आजकल फूहड़ता इत्यादि के प्रयोग से युवाओं में किसी भी प्रकार के कंटेंट को बड़ी सहजता से बनाने का एक चलन बन गया है। इसपर आप क्या कहने चाहेंगे?</strong></p><p>यह आपका निजी चयन है। मैंने कभी नहीं कहा कि मैं केवल साफ़-सुथरी कॉमेडी करूँगा या मेरे शो में फूहड़ता के लिए कोई स्थान नहीं है। बात केवल इतनी है कि मुझे उसे प्रयोग में लाने की आवश्यकता नहीं पड़ी और लोग उसके बगैर ही जुड़ते चले गए जो मेरे लिए बहुत बड़ी बात है। हरेक प्रकार के लोग हैं और उसी मुताबिक भिन्न-भिन्न तरह की ज़रूरतें भी हैं।&nbsp; मैं अपने प्रदर्शन के समय अपने दर्शकों को देखकर समझ जाता हूँ कि उन्हें मेरी बातों में दिलचस्पी आ रही है या नहीं, ताकि मैं अपने शो को बेहतर बना सकूँ। अब उस कॉमेडी में वेज कंटेंट था या नॉन वेज, इससे कोई फ़र्क नहीं पड़ता। इसलिए किसी प्रकार की तुलना करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है कि किसका काम बेहतर है और किसका नहीं। जब तक उनका कोई भी काम आपको हँसा सकता है तब तक सब ठीक है।</p><p><strong>आजकल कॉमेडी में अक्सर देखा जाता है कि कॉमेडियन्स कुछ ऐसा कर जाते हैं जिससे लोग रोष में आ जाते हैं और कलाकारों को केस मुकदमो से होकर गुज़रना पड़ता है। इसपर आपका क्या मत है?</strong></p><p>किसी न किसी बात पर लोग आक्रामक तो होते ही रहते हैं। सबकुछ इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि जिसे आपकी बात बुरी लगी है, उसमें सामर्थ्य कितना है। कोई भी व्यक्ति चिल्लाता उसी पर है जो उसे स्वयं से छोटा जान पड़ता है। आप कभी भी अपने से बड़े ओहदे के लोगों पर नहीं चिल्लाते क्योंकि वो आपको सीधा जवाब दे सकते हैं या आपके जीवन को काफी हद तक प्रभावित कर सकते हैं। आप एक रिक्शेवाले पर चीखना अपने मालिक पर चीखने से अधिक सरल महसूस करते है क्योंकि पदासीन लोगों पर चीखने के कई बुरे परिणाम हो सकते हैं परन्तु एक रिक्शावाला जो अपनी अनंत समस्याओं से पीड़ित है, वह आपके गुस्से का आसान शिकार बन जाता है।</p><p><strong>तो क्या आप यह कहना चाहते हैं कि जिन संगठन अथवा व्यक्ति विशेष को ज्यादा दबा हुआ महसूस होता है, उनपर लोग आसानी से अपना वर्चस्व स्थापित कर लेते हैं?</strong></p><p>भारत में प्रजातंत्र है और सबको अपनी बात बोलने की खुली छूट है। घूम फिर कर बात वहीं आ जाती है कि जो लोग शक्तिशाली होते हैं, वह अपना दम-ख़म दिखाने में कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ते। हमारे घर में भी इसका एक साधारण सा उदाहरण है। घर में सबसे ज़्यादा इज़्ज़त उनकी ही होती है जो पैसे इत्यादि संसाधनों का प्रमुख स्रोत होते हैं। हम जानते हैं कि उनका होना हमारे परिवार की आजीविकाओं को चलाने के लिए बहुत आवश्यक है। शायद इसीलिए घर चलाने वाले लोग हमारे समाज में विशिष्ट नज़रों से देखे जाते हैं।</p><p><strong>चूंकि हमारे पास अब बहुत थोड़ा समय बचा है और आप भी अपनी परफ़ॉर्मेंस को लेकर काफ़ी उत्साहित हैं तो मेरा आख़िरी सवाल आपसे यह है कि आप तो लाखों लोगों की मुस्कान की वजह बने हुए हैं, पर ऐसी कौन सी चीज है जो आपको हँसाती है?</strong></p><p>लोग जिन बातों पर ठहाके लगा कर हँसते हैं, वह बात मुझे कुछ खास नहीं लगती है। अच्छी से अच्छी हास्यास्पद बातें जो लोगों को काफ़ी पसंद आती है, वह मुझे उबाऊ जान पड़ती है। अब मैं इसमें कुछ कर भी नहीं सकता क्योंकि यह मेरी उम्र के साथ-साथ आदत में बदल चुका है। मेरा काम बहुत विस्तृत है जिससे मैं मुँह भी नहीं फेर सकता। फिर भी कुछ मुट्ठीभर चीज़ें हैं जो मुझे भी हँसाती है, वरना जीवन जीना कठिन हो जाएगा। अभी हाल ही में एक तमिल फिल्म 'जय जय हो' आयी थी। मैं चाहूँगा कि आप कुछ अनोखी प्रकार की सिनेमा का भी अनुभव करें। इस फ़िल्म का मुख्य केंद्र घरेलू हिंसा है पर आप इसे बार-बार देखने के लिए विवश हो जाएँगे। 'हॉटस्टार' प्लेटफार्म पर वह हिंदी भाषा में उपलब्ध है। यह फिल्म आपके जीवन में एक खास चीज पर सोचने के नजरिये को बदल देगी। शायद आपने एक पुरानी फिल्म 'भेजा फ्राई' भी देखी होगी। यह सारी फिल्में जीवन के आयाम तय करती हैं जो सैकड़ो अद्भुत विषयों से हो कर आपके जीवन जीने की खूबसूरती में निरंतर बढ़ोढ़ती करती है। यहीं कुछ मनोरंजन के साधन हैं जो मुझे हँसाते रहते हैं और जिनके जरिए मैं ख़ुशी के दो पल लोगों के बीच बाँट पाने में सक्षम हो पाता हूँ। कहते हैं न कि हलवाई अपनी मिठाई खुद नहीं खाता। कुछ वैसा ही मैं भी हूँ।</p>",

Every experience you gain helps you as a whole and I believe societies like Sahitya provide you with a cultural atmosphere that is very essential in a college and you should be surrounded by it. For example, if you write well and you are meeting four people, then you all will grow together. That is what I believe is the function of societies. This is their work. It gives you a platform where you can go and announce, <i>‘Arz kiya hai</i>’. If I would have said this in the hostel, I would have been hushed. Now there (in Sahitya) you can say, ‘<i>Arz kiya hai</i>’, a second person also comes along and says, <i>‘Maine bhi arz kiya hai</i>’ and this, in turn, makes a <i>mehfil</i>. The same goes for Madhurima when someone discovers a new song, soon enough everybody starts analyzing it, wondering what is the music in it. This discussion of art, you cannot do it with everybody. You need to find the right people. They can be your friends or family or society. So that way, it was immensely beneficial.</p><p><strong>How would you describe DTU’s culture and how has it helped you, considering all your sketches and your works of today have been derived from it?</strong></p><p>The best thing that I think of DTU, and of every other engineering college in general, in which DTU provides a lot, is that there is nothing as ‘just study’ here. You sometimes come out better in extra-curricular activities. You get refined and you learn new things. You realize that studying is something that everyone is doing and that is mandatory. You can’t say that you are not doing 5th semester. That is not an option. But you can learn other things like how to organize a fest, how to market a product, and how to work in hospitality. I have learned all these things. Like in hospitality, I learned what is the requirement of a celebrity. Maybe he wants black tea, so where can we get it? That is how you learn how to cope with real-life problems and you become a better person in social dealings. Then you learn the etiquette to converse, you build strong associations similar to how most of the start-ups are. From my college, we were able to take off not because I knew their skill but because I had a good time with them at the hostel. Then we both discussed an idea and developed that skill, then we started the ‘start-up’. Once your vibes match then you feel like, ‘Let’s do something together.’</p><p><strong>Did you try to travel while you were in college?</strong></p><p>We roamed a lot during our time in college. Manali. Kasol. Otherwise, we were just loitering around the hostel. Someone would say let us go to Rishikesh, and then we would go to Rishikesh. Traveling is very necessary. And I would like to tell you this as well - do this (traveling) at this age. It’s better. Once you get into a corporation, you would have a lot of money. Transactions of 1.5 lakhs, on the 1st day of every month, and you will feel like you’re a queen, and then the manager ends up saying that you cannot take any leave for three months, saying “This is a project from America”. So, you won’t be able to do this, then. Try to get as many experiences as you can from this college.</p><p><strong>How has life been after you won that competition? Is it in any way different from what you expected?</strong></p><p>Every day, I feel very overwhelmed. I feel very grateful for the kind of life I’m living because this was a dream. I always used to think that all these big artists live like this, they travel a lot, tour India, and do international shows. Now I feel very blessed to live this life. I’m very thankful. Also, there is a bit of motivation that one gets, there is gratitude and you wonder, “How can this life be so ethereal?”. I feel amazed every day. Earlier I used to feel I had a good day, this will be in my memory for a long time. And then I realized that my whole week was great and that I might remember it my whole life. Which is impractical. It may not be possible. But in the last four-six months that I’ve lived, I feel every day that I will remember it for my lifetime. I cannot imagine a better day. And with God’s grace, I might progress further.</p><p><strong>What has been one of the most defining moments of your career?</strong></p><p>A career-defining moment for me has to be when I left my job. It wasn’t one practically. But internally, it was career-defining. Because once you have a backup plan you rely on that. You get your salary, and you feel great. You feel life is great. You can buy anything. You can go shopping. You can go wherever you want to go. But once you stop that option and consider that there is no Plan B, you challenge yourself and push your boundaries. And for me, that happened just before the lockdown. I got a very good show and it was paying me well. So I realized that if I can earn this much in one day, that my art has so much power in it that it can sort my life in a day or two instead of working for a month then why should I not work on it (art) for the rest of the 28 days as well? The result might be better. I am not talking about the finances but if you can get, in just two days, so much love or recognition and other terrific things like knowledge, and you give the rest 28 days to it as well, then it can bring you a lot on a large scale. All these things would be multi-folded. That was when I felt that this was the right decision for me. So I spent my entire lockdown reading and consuming art. “What kind of art has been created in the world? What have the legends written? Why are they legends? Then I analyzed their art form and then I realized, so this all has happened. Now, what can I do? We can do comedy. This is new for the nation.” So, I think that was my career-defining moment. From there, it was, let us learn, and when you learn a lot you realize what has been circulating in the market and what is not and that is what you can provide. That is how you can become exclusive. I guess that is what can be said about start-ups as well. For example, even Myntra is selling only clothes and so is every other app. But wait till a new app comes. Uber offers you cab rides. Ola offers you cab rides. Maybe there’s a new app that I believe gives discounts and is open to bargain and negotiation. It is a very small change, but now they are exclusive in the market. You need to find that space. “Why am I necessary in this field? Why do they need me?”. When I realized that, that was my career-defining moment.</p><p><strong>When you made that decision, were you afraid?</strong></p><p>I think it’s absolutely normal to be afraid. You get all sorts of thoughts in your mind, I won’t call it fear. But I am a very optimistic person in life. It’s to such an extent that even if I meet with a car accident then I’ll be happy thinking, it wasn’t a truck. I won’t be thinking that it’s an accident. And I knew from the start that I could do it. But I didn’t know the timeline. Might be in six years. So, I had this in my mind, that I might struggle for six years and I don't have money and my peers are growing and I’m not growing. I mean in terms of stature and a life point of view, but I was ready for that. So that was why I wasn’t afraid. You feel fear when you are uncertain. What can be the worst? I knew it could be sleeping on the streets. Because you’ve grown up listening to all these struggle stories and I thought it might be even better if I sleep on the streets. So, I was always ready. And I had good support from my friends and family at DTU. <i>Inshallah</i>, the people were very nice. Whoever I met was supportive. And I think if you are able to find even two people like these then I think your career or your life is made. There were others who, when I was growing up, said I can do this, and I kept doing it. And then it gets into you. So, I wasn’t afraid. No. The main thing was that I was ready for it even if it leads to failure, I’ll cherish it. But eventually, I will make it happen. I don’t know why I believed so much&nbsp;in that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any final advice for the students?</strong></p><p>Advice is to just live your life. I think it’s extremely important. I think the culture that is here now asks you to get a 20 lakh package, just after college. I say, if you get a package of 20 lakhs at 22 then what would you do at 30? I am not saying don’t earn but all I'm saying is if that money is limiting your experiences then take your time. Earn 20 lakhs next year. But just live life simultaneously. I once wrote a<i> sher</i> that followed the lines of -&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>‘Jahan mein ek din aval banoonga</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Magar tum aaj choro, kal banoonga</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Abhi khamosh baitha dekhta hoo</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Kisi din sheher ki halchal banoonga.’</strong></i></p>",

Read on as Tejasv Mohan, Head of Illustrations, DTU Times, 2022-23, brings out the conviction of success in the wildest of situations.</strong></i></p><p>For most people out there, the 'University Phase' is the most eventful phase of early adulthood. A phase that is known to be quite eventful despite its short span; a fact that most of us knew already, even before completing the earlier phases of middle and high school. This leads to a staircase where, at every step, we expect and imagine building memories of our college lives, similar to a kid playing with Lego blocks. One at a time, slowly connecting blocks piece by piece, we create something fruitful to be mesmerized by. Even so, there are a few bigger, stronger, unbeatable events that can effortlessly derail the formative years of adulthood. And, as a member of the COVID batch, I can attest to the immense sense of loss we have felt over the past two years quite heavily. It took an unprecedented pandemic, as mad as a March hare, that no one in their right mind anticipated, to rob us of the college experience we had dreamed of for years prior.</p><p>We were the Scheherazades of our time, desperately trying to hold onto the memories of what college life could have been. We created makeshift traditions and rituals, trying to make the most of what little time we had together. We held virtual events, Zoom parties, and online games, trying to connect with each other through screens and pixels. It was never enough, and the desperation for college memories only grew stronger as the months went by. We watched as our peers from previous years reminisced about their wild adventures and crazy stories. Meanwhile, we sat at home, finishing our coursework in our pajamas.</p><p>We longed for the late-night conversations in hostels, the spontaneous road trips, the crowded fests, and the deep conversations about life near OAT. We missed the feeling of being surrounded by people who were going through the same things as us, those who understood the struggle of balancing academics and social life.</p><p>But most of all, we missed the sense of belonging that came with being part of a college community as a whole. The feeling that we were all in this world and youth together, that we were building something bigger than ourselves. And yet, despite all of this, we refused to give up. We held onto the hope that someday, somehow, we would get to experience all of those things that we had missed out on. We clung to the idea that our college memories were not lost forever, that we would make new memories, even if they were not the ones we had originally envisioned. This led to a spiral where we tried to make memories out of anything possible, even if it meant lying to ourselves for the sake of it. To my fellow batchmates who are graduating this year, please do not fall into this mentally tolling spiral of making souvenirs out of everything. Let’s not lose our hope. Let’s continue to hold onto the memories we have, and let us make new memories wherever we can. Let us be the Scheherazades of our time, telling stories of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><p>Our college experience may not have been what we expected, but that does not mean it was not valuable. We have learned to adapt, to be creative, and to never take for granted the moments we spend together. And who knows? Maybe someday, when we are all old and grey, we will look back on these years with a sense of fondness and nostalgia, remembering the time when we were forced to be apart but still managed to find a way to come together. And, on a final note of importance — we’re all going to make it. Trust the process and trust yourself.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Tejasv Mohan, Head of Illustrations, DTU Times, 2022-23</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

I was overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the campus. The first few days were spent catching up with school friends who ended up here, just to share the delight of it. As time passed, my clock started revolving around the idea of societies and roaming the campus with batchmates turned friends. I’d turn up pretty much anywhere that offered me an opportunity to learn something - anything.</p><p>I spent months getting accustomed to the culture here - from society meetings, to drawing up ED sheets with my friends, all the way up to slogging “one-week-before-the-mid-sems”. Late-night calls meant to complete lab files turned into cherished conversations with friends.&nbsp;</p><p>But before I could go ahead with my adrenaline-filled first-year self, the pandemic struck. It was pinching at first, but slowly, acceptance took over uncertainty. I found myself more involved in college clubs, which no longer held only professional significance for me, but also served as my second family. Despite the rather abrupt transition from SPSs and Mic-Mac to Google Meet, we eventually found solace in calling up our friends late in the nights saying, “<i>Meet aaja yaar</i>”.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, this is when I truly discovered my role at a college society I proudly call my own - IEEE DTU. During my relentless struggle to figure out what I wanted to do in life, I was indeed blessed with seniors who were somehow always open to my endless ramblings, making IEEE not just a group, but a community.This was also around when I discovered Times. I never thought I would go from filing a “Recruiting Designers” form to compiling a whole edition of my university newsletter. The team went through its ups and downs, but Times was always close to my heart - something that would open the gates to my “<i>yaadon ka pitara</i>” even fifteen years from now.</p><p>A year into the pandemic, we started settling into the culture of surprise tests and online movie nights. Carrying forward what I had learnt, I made my pre-final year more about giving. I wanted to help everyone I could with what little I had accumulated over the years. I was hit by a sense of disappointment attached to the internship season that had just gone by, but I knew in my heart that something larger was in line for me - and I started working on something that forms part of their bucket list for many - my startup. I spent days and nights relentlessly trying to “create” something. We went from an idea on a call, to a tangible prototype, to incubation at the IIF.</p><p>Cut to 2022 - after 3 semesters of Google Classroom, we find ourselves standing at the edge of OAT once again. A lot had changed, but the will was right there - intact as ever.The offline part of college seemed to go by in a blink as I was about to go into my last semester. We were all ready to pack our bags in another six months and leave for our corporate offices. Any chances of finding something new seemed rather minuscule until I found myself on a trip with 5 people to a fest that we had all been eagerly waiting for - Mood Indigo. I never expected to find, on a trip to a new city in my final year, some of the most adored friendships of my college life. I did everything from observing sunsets to dancing at concerts with people I had always known but never felt connected to until just now.We enter college with bated breath - wondering what to expect from this seemingly alien yet homely place. Our image of what we wish to become is often markedly different from what we end up becoming. But somehow, on the day of the batch photograph, meeting acquaintances and friends, it feels as though everything has fallen into place. It’s not an all-happy album that we take away. But in the end, it all seems to have worked out for the best.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Nupur Kapoor, 1st Year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

To me, there is nothing more alive than sharing glimpses of the vast human experience and leaving others with their own stories to cherish. I have one such storyteller for you, one that has accompanied us through the most formative years of our lives–our college, DTU. As we prepare to bid farewell, I am struck by the countless tales of friendship, love, laughter, and learning that its walls have been privy to more than ever before. The campus holds a plethora of secrets that gradually reveal themselves to you over time. You learn how to navigate the paths that once had you lost and fatigued. You discover your own little havens amidst the bustling crowd. You befriend the campus dogs and maybe even give them names. You know exactly where to find a cool spot in the library and when to head to the MechC for piping hot samosas. You imbibe the vibrant vibes of DTU, carrying it with you as you step out into the world beyond its walls.&nbsp;</p><p>In your final year, you might spend less time on campus and the nostalgia of your time at DTU washes over you, making you keenly aware of how it has shaped you and the idiosyncrasies that it has left you with. Even when the world outside is harsh and unforgiving, I take comfort in the memories of the tranquil sunsets at the OAT that never failed to lift my spirits. And when someone is rude to me, I think back to the time I relentlessly pestered Chandan Bhaiya for my order of Maggi, and it puts things into perspective. Even a simple sip of tea can transport me back to the warm, cardamom-infused tea I savored on cold evenings at Nescafe. Though I may feel lost in the crowd at times, I cherish the memories of how I found my people amidst the thousands and had the time of my life with them over four unforgettable years. DTU will have a fascinating way of accompanying you throughout your life. I still remember the sense of wonder I felt when I first stepped into college, unsure of what the future held. Today, as I prepare to leave, I find myself standing at a similar crossroads, with the vast world waiting for me. But my time at DTU leaves me filled with hope and eagerness for what awaits me. And I am sure such is the case for all my fellow DTU’23 batchmates. So if you ever find yourself in the company of a DTU graduate, don't hesitate to ask them about their college days. For with the stories that live with us, we carry a piece of DTU, and the storyteller lives on.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration by Harshana Pillai, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>College is hard. There are way too many people, way too many memories to make and forget, and way too many grades to secure in this tumultuous journey of 4 years. But after doing it all, all we’re left with is the moments we make after pushing through every day of the 1460 we’re supposed to. As one makes their way to the college gate at the end of the day, there’s just one sensation in our heads- the feeling of toiling throughout the day, yet emerging victorious to be able to go for it the next time. Some days are so bad that you feel like disappearing into thin air, into &nbsp;something that isn’t palpable anymore, yet some days are so good that you wish to remain in the moment- be it receiving a good grade, having the best food at the canteen, or just good weather. But when we wake up, we choose to have a day. A day that takes us in whatever way it’s supposed to.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Read on as Ritvik Nair, Managing Editor, DTU Times, reminds us that bidding farewell is never easy, however it may seem to be and that there is just something about bidding adieu, that makes it difficult to even digest the idea of it.</strong></i></p><p>The young squire stared deep into the dragon’s ruby eyes. Even as flames within its eyes were snuffed out, the dragon struggled, trying to lash out at the squire with its long man-sized claws. Its efforts were fruitless however, for the squire had already dealt a fatal blow and a grim crimson oozed out of the hole on the dragon his sword had left.</p><p>Soon, the dragon fell, shaking the ground as a final rebellion against his fate. Upon confirming the dragon’s demise, the now knight stuck his sword on the ground and leaned against it. A shaky yet wide grin plastered on his face. His vision clouded as tears started flowing out of his eyes. Tears dropped onto the hilt of his sword, flowing down onto the ground and making streaks on the dragon’s blood that clung to the blade.</p><p>The young knight dragged his feet to his foe’s corpse. He ran his fingers over its brilliant red scales. Suddenly, his legs gave and he tumbled onto his buttocks. He looked up at the clear blue sky and laughed, tears still streaming down his messy face.</p><p>After sitting beside his foe for a while, the knight wiped his face on his sleeves. He then stood up and retrieved his sword. It was finally over. Four years of intensive preparation, training, and planning had finally paid off. With a smile on his face, he pointed his sword at the felled foe.</p><p>“Farewell,” he said, “old friend.”</p><p>Then, he was off. Soon, he would be officially knighted. Yet, he anticipated more of what was to come after. For becoming a knight was only just the beginning. The beginning of many adventures to come.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Nafisa Ruheen, 2nd Year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Read on as Shikhar Rana, Head of Design, DTU Times tells about the stressful and emotionless corporate life and Tyler Durden's way of getting rid of this system</strong></i></p><p>You see, I’m sick and tired of the way things are in this world. People are living their lives like zombies, slaves to their jobs, their possessions, and their status symbols. Often feels like we are all just cogs in a machine, endlessly churning away at our jobs, day in and day out. The 9-to-5 grind has become the norm, and seems like everyone is expected to give it all, just to keep up.</p><p>But at what cost?</p><p>The truth is that society is manufacturing 9-to-5 slaves every day. From a young age, you are conditioned to follow a descending path: “go to school, get good grades, go to college, and get a job”. A one-size-fits-all model that doesn’t give a damn about your skills and passion. And once in the workforce, you have to put in long hours, be available 24/7, and sacrifice your personal life for the sake of your job. And for what? To climb the corporate ladder, to earn a bigger paycheck, to keep up with our peers?</p><p>It’s a vicious cycle that leads to burnout, stress, emptiness, and disconnection. So, I started a place where men can come together and resist the system, resist the establishment that’s keeping us all down. It’s a way to wake people up, to get them to feel alive again.</p><p>And as this place grows, so does my mission. The only way to escape this existential emptiness is to reject the status quo and embrace chaos and destruction. We’re going to sabotage corporate offices, cause disorder in the city, and show people that there’s another way to live.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I know this all sounds crazy to some people. But that’s the point. We need to shake things up, to challenge the status quo. Because if we don’t, we’re just going to keep living our lives like mindless drones.</p><p>&nbsp;So, that’s my mission. It’s bold, it’s ambitious, and it’s not without its risks. But I truly believe that it’s worth it, that we can make a difference in this world if we just have the courage to try. My name is Tyler Durden</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Akshata, 2nd year, B.des.</strong></i></p>",

Heavy stress on “decent”.</p><p>Good music — music that gets your head bobbing and your feet tapping — doesn’t just come into existence, it needs to be worked upon. Constantly. Painfully. At its peak, the 10 x 10 jamroom above MechC will become your home, and the soreness in your fingers will become your constant.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step is the melody. Sometimes it comes to you naturally, but most times you’re pressed, and you have to force it out. You’ll get your phone out, and you’ll record yourself humming — twice, thrice, five times, seventy three times before it feels right. You’ll get it down on a guitar, and, if you can get your mates to approve it, you’ll move on happily to step two.</p><p>This next step is easy — chords. Music 101. Your ear’s trained by now, and you know instinctively what will and won’t work. You keep throwing until something sticks and usually, it sticks.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s break time now. You have — not technically a song — but something that sounds good. The music runs through your head for the rest of the day — through Data Structures, the song is fast, upbeat; through DBMS it’s slow and calm. By the time you hit the jam room again, you find you’ve already decided what works best, and the rhythm is set.&nbsp;</p><p>Next you add the phrasing and the percussion. For the non musicians, percussion is the beats, the rhythm, the drums,<i> the bop</i>, the phrasing means the notes you play in a certain way to convey a message. Again, easy — trial and error.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re ready! Oh sure, you have the lyrics left, and the title, but you don’t focus on them — they’re icing. No, your focus is on the hardest part — Practice! Practice! Practice! How do you get through it? Friends, obviously! You play John Cena’s entrance, and the room has to get up and salute. You compete, you trash talk, you joke, you laugh, you scream and the music plays on.&nbsp;</p><p>Your day has come — Homecoming fest, and the stadium is full. You walk in, and the crowd screams. Nervous? Nah. You dyed your hair blue for this! You walk out there, and the world turns upside down. Suddenly, all your sweat, blood and tears make sense. They love you, and you love them, and there’s nowhere else on Earth you would rather be.</p><p>Hold on — there’s one more step.</p><p>You’ll leave the jam room for the last time, and that smell will linger just a little as you turn to leave. In that moment, you’ll remember all the good times you had in this room, all the beauty you helped create, all the people you created it with. You might say a quiet last word or you might remain silent, but eventually you’ll turn around and close the door, your guitar case suddenly heavy.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Navya Singh, 1st Year, EE</strong></i></p>",

I'll head back too. See you tomorrow!\"</p><p>\"Bye-bye!\"</p><p>I bid my friends adieu and started walking towards my hostel, which happened to be on the opposite side of the campus. A smile makes its way onto my face as I realise the long walk means more time for myself. I clutch the straps of my backpack, cock my head back and look up at the beautiful evening sky. My smile slowly widens, and my eyes instinctively close, embracing the serene beauty in that blissful moment of solitude.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the time I spend with people I'm fond of is precious, and I wouldn't give that up for anything. However, sometimes, one just needs to unplug from the noise of college life. For an introvert, college can often feel like a whirlwind of activity and stimulation. As an introvert, I constantly sought respite amidst the frenzied chaos of college life. The never-ending flow of people, events, and information became overwhelming at times, and I often retreated to my own world to find balance and recharge. As I started on my way, I put on my headphones almost as if it was second nature and queued up my favourite playlist as I readied myself to relish the peace and quiet on the walk back.</p><p>I see the library to my side, and a wave of memories from the last four years flash in front of me as I reminisce the countless hours of precious me-time I spent there. A library may seem like an unconventional place to attach one's core memories to, but for someone who cherishes a moment away from the hustle and bustle simply to savour the solitude - the library serves as the perfect abode. Nothing pleased me more than finding a secluded corner where I could lose myself in a book or work on an assignment in my own little zone. I feel a deep sense of calm and contentment in these moments, my worries and anxieties melting away like snowflakes on a warm spring day.</p><p>I make my way towards the OAT, where all the colours of the college are on display. The people huddled up on the stairs for society meets, benches flocked with groups of friends, sparsely scattered people sitting by themselves, engrossed in their own little amusements - the OAT manages to capture a diverse yet homogenous image of the college culture. Being a spectator to this familiar yet serene scene grants me an immense sense of tranquillity. Witnessing the quintessential DTU evening takes me back to the evenings I spent on the lawns, under the twilight sky, with a book and a puppy nestled up to my side. I end up incessantly romanticising these moments because these cherishable fragments of time are what I look back at with immense fondness. These moments are like oases in the desert of college life, where I can pause and reflect.</p><p>As I make my way towards the girls' hostel, a bittersweet realisation dawns on me - the precious 'me-time' I had savoured along the way was coming to an end. These moments of stillness are not a luxury, but a necessity, a lifeline that sustains me and gives me the strength to navigate the ever-changing waters of college life. I come to terms with the fact that with my chapter at DTU coming to a close, I didn't have many campus walks left to add to my piggybank of cherishable memories.</p><p>I turn around, queue my playlist and cock my head back to take in the mesmerising evening sky once again. The vivid canvas of the shades of dusk looks even more inviting, causing a subconscious smile to appear on my face once again as I begin another campus walk.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Tanvi, 2nd Year, B.Des</strong></i></p>",

Delve into her reflections on the lingering desires for greater achievements and the unwilling conviction that, if granted the opportunity to relive those extraordinary days, not a single thing would be changed.</strong></i></p><p>Over the past few months, as I have inexorably moved towards the finish line<strong> </strong>that marks the end of my college journey, my thoughts seem to be increasingly occupied with a certain ‘mental checklist’ my 18-year-old self had created before she first entered the arched gates of DTU. After spending the majority of my school life as a wallflower, I had vowed to be more popular, confident, and sophisticated by the time I graduated—things I hadn’t the gall to aspire to in the past. What I <i>hadn’t</i> counted on, however, was that instead of being the gateway to fantasyland I had imagined it to be, college has been far more reminiscent of a comedy of errors, with me as an unwilling protagonist.&nbsp;</p><p>It all started the day I entered the campus for the first time; as my eyes wandered uneasily over the sheer magnitude of the DTU student body, I wondered how impossible it would be to stand out in a crowd like this. This dread became even more pronounced as the days went by; as my grip on academics slipped and I struggled to find my niche in this gifted crowd, the only thing that gave me some measure of comfort was the fact that I still had a lot of time to turn things around. I suppose the final nail in the coffin of my ambitions was driven by the pandemic which, in my mind, cheated me of the quintessential college experience I deserved and in turn, prevented the metamorphosis I had so dearly wished for. Perhaps the only thing I had going for me was that I was a part of the illustrious DTU Times team but here too, I’ve spent so much of my time plagued with insecurities regarding everything from my writing to my ability to lead. I suppose it is only fair to say that an unbiased appraisal of my trajectory over the past four years can only yield disappointment.&nbsp;</p><p>Why then, do I find myself clutching at the last vestiges of my time here, unwilling, or perhaps, incapable of letting go? Equally puzzling is the revelation that despite failing to achieve the goals I had set for myself earlier, I have moved further along the road to self-acceptance than I had ever imagined possible. It is true that on the face of it, nothing seems to have changed; my annoying trait of blending into the wallpaper remains as pronounced as ever and I’m probably the least self-assured senior I know. Perhaps the only thing that has changed is the way that I perceive my flaws–not as chinks in my armour but as a set of unique quirks that make me who I am.&nbsp;</p><p>As I have achieved things I had never thought possible–bagging an internship offer when I had absolutely no hope of making it, receiving the great honour of leading the DTU Times team despite the first-year me being so sure that she wouldn’t survive a single month here and even managing to build fulfilling and supportive friendships despite my many eccentricities–the one thing I have learned through it all is this—hat <i>even in times when I find myself crippled with self-doubt, I am and will always be enough. </i>Though I may still stammer my way through a conversation and panic at the thought of making important decisions, I now know that these imperfections can no longer act as impediments to my progress. Do I sometimes wish that I had achieved more during my time here? Yes, of course, but even in those moments of doubt, in my heart of hearts, I know that if I were to relive these days again, I wouldn’t change a thing.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Mehak Singhal, 3rd Year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

Read on as N. Krithika, Student Head, DTU Times, 2022-23, embraces her inner power and fearlessly peers into the Eye of the Tiger, discovering her true strengths</strong></i></p><p>The Eye of the Tiger is synonymous with strength, determination, and resilience. It signifies the fierce and unflinching spirit that drives individuals to achieve their goals, irrespective of the hardships that come. This phrase is mainly associated with the world of sports, where athletes strive to cultivate the same spirit of determination and strength that is represented by the tiger's eye. However, for me, the phrase holds an essentially different meaning. For me, it means the clarity of thought in the minds of people these days and how one can’t get away from one's eye after committing a wrong deed. “The Eye of the Tiger” signifies that you will always be watched by someone and it is very important to do the right thing to have a clear conscience.&nbsp;<br><br>There is something about the tiger, a poem of the liberty of pure genes which is meant to roam freely in its wild spirit and majestic demeanour. My fascination for tigers emerged when I went for my first-ever safari with my family in the hope of citing the mighty cat. We paved our way amidst the dense forest with the leaves dancing to a mysterious beat as if whispering their song to the wind in the arboreal air. We saw monkeys swinging by the trees, a herd of deers crossing the road, and thousands of birds chirping and enjoying the chilly breeze. To our surprise, we received a call that a tiger was sighted near the river. We rushed there just to witness the magnificence of the majestic animal. I could see its lustrous coat gleaming with pride, panting and silently growling, looking at me - eye to eye. Remember how it was a windy day? Well, the trees stopped swaying for me at that very instance.&nbsp;</p><p>I would never forget the moment - my first encounter with a tiger. It got me thinking, is it only me or are all humans this weak that a stare-down could alter our lives altogether? It felt like the tiger could see right through me - my past, present and future. I believe that the eye of the tiger always exists. Someone somewhere is always watching us, monitoring our actions and observing our deeds, good or bad. One can never comprehend how a small action can lead to bigger consequences. This can also be related to what people call the “Butterfly Effect''.</p><p>Tigers are the living embodiment of fortitude and brilliance. Just like them, one should never hesitate to trust their instincts and let their brilliance shine. With this hope, our batch entered the placement season which offers abundant opportunities to learn, grow and make mistakes, most certainly being a difficult path to tread. There was a time when I reached an impasse, getting rejected in the very last round of a firm which I had coveted for a long time. I was devastated but I realized this was the time to be the strongest version of myself and be bold enough to go through the process of learning, unlearning and relearning without making excuses for my failures.&nbsp;</p><p>One should never be delusional about reality and be honest with oneself. Picking yourself up in the tough times, diligently observing your own actions, being strong enough to accept what is wrong and not falling into the labyrinth of being right every time is the only way forward. Always look at your inner self from <i>the eye of a tiger.</i></p>",

Read on as Saatvik Agarwal, Head of Design, DTU Times, reflects on the magic and madness of friendship, of the love and hope and understanding which is woven together in the strangest way possible.</strong></p><p>Being someone who shifted around a lot, I’ve constantly had to meet new people and be part of different &amp; exciting experiences and interactions. The times I’ve had, man! Take it from a guy who was in more than 5 schools in just the last 3 years of his school life, life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what unexpected lesson you may get in what phase of your life. One such phase is college life.</p><p>College is a time of growth and exploration, a period of our lives where we transition from adolescence into adulthood. During this time, we forge friendships and relationships that can shape our lives for years to come. As a graduating student, I can say without hesitation that some of the best memories I’ve made in college have been with my friends. From late night brainstorming sessions to weekend adventures, my college friendships have been an essential part of my growth and development.</p><p>One of my fondest memories was during my junior (third) year, when my friends and I decided to take an impromptu bus trip to Rishikesh. Packed into a double-decker bus, we embarked on a journey filled with deep conversations. We stayed in a traveller hostel where we met a ton of strangers, coincidentally, even our super seniors from college and we took some of them along to explore the city on our rented scooties. We even befriended a group of girls who we invited to come along with us on possibly one of the most beautiful routes a person can travel on by a 2 wheeler to add to our ultimate bollywood vacation.</p><p>But it wasn’t just the fun times that made my college friendships so meaningful. We also shared some tough moments together. One of the hardest parts of navigating college friendships is when people change and grow apart, leading to feelings of betrayal and loneliness. It took me a long time to process what had happened and to come to terms with the fact that sometimes friendships just don’t last forever. But in that difficult time, I also learned a lot about controlling my emotions and resilience, and that even though it may seem like it, we are not alone. I learned that it’s important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship and that it’s okay to let go of relationships that are no longer serving us, even if it may hurt us the most doing so.</p><p>Despite the challenges, my college friendships have been some of the most rewarding and fulfilling relationships I’ve had. Whether we were laughing over coffee in our PG or crying together after a tough week of work, my friends have been there for me through it all, offering support and encouragement and reminding each other of our strength and resilience. And even when our paths diverge with some and we grow apart, I know that the memories we’ve made together will always be a cherished part of my college experience.</p><p>So, to all the college students out there, cherish your friendships and hold them close. They may not last forever, but they have the power to shape who you become. Challenges are inevitable, but how we navigate them defines our growth. As I prepare to graduate and move on to the next phase of my life, I know that I’ll always look back on my college friendships with fondness and gratitude.</p><p>The campus size that scares you in the beginning would eventually shrink in comparison to the memories you make in it because frankly, there is no part of college that won’t bring up a wonderful memory for me and those memories weren’t made alone.</p><p><strong>Illustration Credits: Akshata, 2nd&nbsp;Year,&nbsp;B.Des.</strong></p>",

I held a pretty good ranking, I remember I stood second in the college.&nbsp;</p><p>During the internship season, Google came first. I gave the test and was pretty confident with the DSA part, I didn't have many issues there. I was selected for the Google interviews but they were scheduled for a month later.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, Sprinklr conducted an online test which I cleared. My first interview was around 8 AM. I generally wake up at 2 PM, so, at first I had difficulty waking up and I was very sleepy once the interview started. They gave me easy problems but I think I didn’t communicate properly. Still, I thought I had done well and I was waiting for the next interview round, but then I was told they are not continuing with my process. I was shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>I reassured myself that at least there was Google’s interview remaining. I practiced my communication skills for that, and did a few mock interviews as well, to communicate my ideas in a more structured way. The interview timings suited me— I wasn’t sleepy this time! They asked pretty straightforward and easy questions. By the end of the day, the results came and I was selected, so I was really happy.&nbsp;</p><p>My internship was quite decent. The projects I was given weren't as tough as imagined. Once they were done, I was working on the documentation and presentation. I finally got the PPO from Google then so I didn’t sit in the placements at all.&nbsp;</p><p>What advice would you give to juniors preparing for SDE roles at top product firms?</p><p>For people who are trying to crack big companies such as Google, I’d advise them to focus on problem-solving along with their core subject. You should have a decent enough CGPA and good problem-solving skills because, in the coding round of interviews, the questions are a bit challenging. Coding is a part of the only test, so once that is cleared it all comes down to your communication skills.&nbsp;</p><p>I think most people do badly at interviews because of stress, so I’d say don’t think about it too much. I know it’s easier said than done. Just work on your skills, have fun and try not to worry about the results.&nbsp;</p><p>What works and doesn’t work for an SDE resume?</p><p>From what I’ve seen when companies come to college; if you have 1-2 good projects to put on your resume and your GPA is good, I think that is just enough. They will shortlist you for the coding test. As far as resumes are concerned I believe it is better to have a good project or two which you have a clear idea about, that’s the main thing.&nbsp;</p><p>You should have good problem-solving skills. Every company requires Python and Database skills in some way. You can learn Linux and put that down too. If you put something on your resume you should know about it.</p><p>&nbsp;Also one should understand that having one resume for different companies is not always the key. We can’t apply to every company with the same resume. When I applied for Tower Research I tweaked my resume a little to highlight the skills that were relevant to that role. Just play to your strengths.&nbsp;</p>",

I held a pretty good ranking, I remember I stood second in the college. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>During the internship season, Google came first. I gave the test and was pretty confident with the DSA part, I didn't have many issues there. I was selected for the Google interviews but they were scheduled for a month later. &nbsp;<br><br>In the meantime, Sprinklr conducted an online test which I cleared. My first interview was around 8 AM. I generally wake up at 2 PM, so, at first I had difficulty waking up and I was very sleepy once the interview started. They gave me easy problems but I think I didn’t communicate properly. Still, I thought I had done well and I was waiting for the next interview round, but then I was told they are not continuing with my process. I was shocked. &nbsp;<br><br>I reassured myself that at least there was Google’s interview remaining. I practiced my communication skills for that, and did a few mock interviews as well, to communicate my ideas in a more structured way. The interview timings suited me— I wasn’t sleepy this time! They asked pretty straightforward and easy questions. By the end of the day, the results came and I was selected, so I was really happy. &nbsp;<br><br>My internship was quite decent. The projects I was given weren't as tough as imagined. Once they were done, I was working on the documentation and presentation. I finally got the PPO from Google then so I didn’t sit in the placements at all. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What advice would you give to juniors preparing for SDE roles at top product firms?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>For people who are trying to crack big companies such as Google, I’d advise them to focus on problem-solving along with their core subject.

Also, the preparation for this was not very tedious. Your resume should be on point. It should be in the correct format and well-structured.</p><p><strong>Was there any specific technical skill on which you have worked on for this role?</strong></p><p>For non-tech placements, there is a set of skills that enhance your resume, but there is no specific skill that you really need. In technical skills, you have SQL, MS Excel, etc. They add to your resume but they are not the deciding factor.</p><p><strong>What are the skills that are required to work in multinational corporations?</strong></p><p>The first thing I learned is that your body language and confidence plays a major role. The second thing they notice is how you communicate.</p><blockquote><p>Focus on the soft skills. Your introduction in the interviews is very significant. People do say that placements are based on luck but I think it's your soft skills that makes a difference.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What do the recruiters consider while interviewing any candidate?</strong></p><p>The employers don't just look for technical skills. They look for people who can easily adjust in their company or organization. Read about the organization before giving your interviews. They are not looking for people who are completely study-oriented. They look for an overall personality.</p><p><strong>What are your future goals as you have been placed in one of the most prestigious companies?</strong></p><p>I plan to work for some time at McKinsey.

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Digant Rastogi, EE, Class of 2023, who got an offer from Google in their Hardware vertical.&nbsp;</strong></i><br><br><strong>Tell us a bit about your placement journey. How did you come to the decision that you would be choosing a hardware-related role? How did you prepare for such a job opportunity?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>During my first year, it became quite clear to me that there were three ways I could go—tech, non-tech or core. Most people tend to go for tech as it is quite popular these days, but it was always clear to me that I wanted to get into core electrical related jobs. During our second year, we studied digital electronics and analog electronics. These subjects fascinated me a lot and the whole topic of VLSI really got me interested. I’d say you can get about 60% of your preparation out of the way just by paying attention in college and covering the three topics of digital electronics, analog electronics and network analysis since these are the topics interviewers ask most questions from. So, I’d say college is incredibly crucial for people looking to go into core electronics or core electrical.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What was your interview experience like? Was Google your first choice since you must have had many other interviews?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>I haven't given many interviews since i got selected in my very first in both internship season and placement season. But, what I’ve felt is that interviewers seldom test your knowledge during the interview. Rather, they look for how exactly you approach a problem presented to you and how you deal with situations wherein you do not know the answer. So, you need to be fairly expressive about how you’re thinking about approaching the problem and whether you’d like to try answering the question despite not knowing the exact answer.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What advice do you have for someone who’s looking to get into a hardware related job with respect to how they should prepare for their interview? Take us through how your Google interview was like.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The Google interview had 3 rounds, with every round getting progressively harder. As I said, they’re not as focused on you knowing the answer as they are on finding out more about how you present your answers and how you approach the given problem. Moreover, even when we sometimes know the correct answer, we’re not able to present it well enough. So that is another thing that we must work on bettering. The most difficult part of my interview was the HR questions since there were no simple yes/no questions. Each question presented a unique situation where they expect an appropriate response from you.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Many students feel that they need to give up their personal time with friends and family to prepare for their placements. Do you agree with this notion or do you think that academics and personal life can be balanced?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There are 2000 kids in every batch, so it's not very practical to compare yourself to others because everyone has different aspirations. Some wish to go for higher studies while some wish to get a good placement so you cannot compare the amount of time you are devoting to studies with others since they might have an entirely different goal altogether. You can definitely balance out the fun with academics since I &nbsp;personally do not feel that I missed out on anything. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Did you have any setbacks during your time at college and if so how did you bounce back to where you are right now?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I had my fair share of setbacks and I did not bounce back immediately from them. But one thing I love about this college is that there are so many opportunities to redeem yourself. Even if you’ve missed out on a placement or an internship there’s always some or the other message on whatsapp groups presenting you with new opportunities. Especially in terms of placement, even if you don't get placed in the first one or two months there’s plenty of companies to come and I’m sure that most students would get decent placements. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What unique qualities would you say sets a student apart from the rest of the field?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>A well-written resume is incredibly important in my opinion, since your resume speaks for you. Another crucial thing would be having a good GPA. Lastly and perhaps most importantly would be communications skills. There’s no point having a good resume and a decent GPA if you’re not able to communicate to the interviewer why exactly you’d be perfect for the job. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>What advice would you give to juniors looking to get decent placements?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Firstly, get your resumes looked at by a senior since you can't find the mistakes that your seniors would probably recognise quite easily. Another thing you can do is get some sample resumes from your seniors. Give as many mock interviews as you can for further improving your communication skills. Study regularly for exams and maintain a good GPA.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you feel like you’re leaving a part of yourself behind as you transition from a student to an employee?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There’s definitely many quirks of being a student; you can make mistakes and not expect there to be too many consequences, so there’s more freedom to try new things and learn from them. So I’ll miss the opportunities and flexibility of changing your mind about what you wish to do and of course meeting people from different backgrounds with different aspirations.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Harsh Gupta, ME, Class of 2023, who got an offer from Homecentre - Landmark Group for the Business Analyst profile in Dubai. &nbsp;</strong></i><br><br><strong>Can you tell us briefly about your placement journey? &nbsp;</strong><br><br>In the first year, I explored all my options. But I knew my interest lies in non-tech. Initially, I tried doing coding-related projects but mechanical felt like the right path for me, so I shifted my trajectory to pursue it. I applied to mechanics-related roles and did 6-7 internships in the last three years. I worked at MakeMyTrip as a Product Manager, before that I had an on-campus internship at PwC as a Technology Consultant.&nbsp;<br><br>From the second year, I started building my profile—PoRs, recognitions, achievements, and internships. As the placement season came closer, I studied case studies. I practiced them on my own on weekdays and then on weekends I had a friend over. My senior took mock interviews for me and based on those, I made changes and checked if my approach was working. Basically, I opted for the most streamlined approach to solving any case study.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>How was your interview experience? If you got any rejection post-interview, was that a learning experience in your journey toward your final interview with Landmark?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Based on my profile, I was sure that &nbsp;I would get placed in a month or two. But, for some reason, I was not placed till November. I got called for interviews and performed well. I reached the final stage but after that, my name didn’t appear on the list. This happened to me in almost every company I applied for. &nbsp;<br><br>When Landmark came, I was not very keen on applying there because it is in Dubai. They conducted five offline rounds. The first was resume shortlisting. First, we had an aptitude test followed by group discussions. There were 15-20 candidates in front of two interviewers. Group discussion majorly involves agreeing with their points and quickly saying what you want to say before you miss the cue. &nbsp;<br><br>The next round was quite stressful. They asked if I am willing to relocate to Dubai, why this role, why risk it for a country I’ve never been to, why I wasn’t placed yet. In the next round, they gave me five case studies. After I solved all of them and walked out of the interview, I felt confident that I have done my best and that maybe this is the place where all this will end.&nbsp;<br><br>By then, it was almost 11:30 PM, we had been there since 7 AM. A friend of mine came from the hostel, and he was worried. I simply smiled and said, “This is it.” Within ten minutes, they handed us the shortlist and I was in it.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you have some awkward or light-hearted moments during this time?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Oh. definitely. In one, I was in the last round and they had a camera on the top of my head through which they were seeing and listening to whatever I was saying. &nbsp;And they did not care whatsoever. I am saying something and one of them casually goes to fill his glass of water. One of them completely disappeared and so I stopped but then his voice came from another room saying, “Keep Speaking.”&nbsp;<br><br>Then in another, my first round was flawless. Or I thought so because very quickly they rejected me and instead recruited forty-something people. After this setback, I took a vacation to Mussoorie and even there I had an online interview that went smoothly. The panelists were asking me where I have been vacationing, I showed them the view and we were laughing and having a good time. And then, the list came and I was not selected. Imagine, laughing and discussing the weather, and still, they don’t take you.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>So considering it took you six months you must have had that one moment looking back at which you must think, this has been my rock bottom. How did you bounce back from that to bagging this placement at Landmark?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>My rock bottom must have been the time when this company recruited forty-something people. After that, I just thought, “Whatever is to happen, will happen.” Because nothing was in my hands. I had a good resume, I was giving my best in all the interviews. I was clearing all the aptitude tests. I wasn't disagreeing with anything even when some company said, will you relocate or will you do this or that? I never disagreed. So all I had in my hand was to keep applying. And that I did, till November which was still three months ahead at that time.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>How do you feel about this transition from a student to an employee? Do you have any future goals and plans?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Definitely, life is becoming more streamlined. Now you might not have time to pursue a number of things. You would be committing to a single work profile for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;<br><br>I am planning for MBA and I was preparing for GMAT but due to some personal reasons I haven’t been able to study and so I won’t be applying this year. I wanted to give it before I go to Dubai but now I don’t think that’s feasible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What advice would you give to a junior aspiring for similar roles?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Keep struggling. There is a little bit of luck factor that also comes into play. When a lot of people around you are getting placed and you just think, “he must have had luck because he had no achievements whatsoever”. So I would just say that keep struggling because luck favors the one who struggles.&nbsp;<br><br>Do as many internships as you can. Don’t worry if your profile is up to it or not. Even if you are prepared, rejection is never in your hand. So just apply.&nbsp;<br><br>Be patient. Be confident. Never lose hope. And don’t listen to others. Always listen to what you think is best for you. Because in the end, only you know what is best for you. Only you.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Anshuman Pandey, B. Des, Class of 2023 who was offered the role of Industrial Designer at Bosch.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>Please tell us about your Internship and placement journey. When did you decide you wanted to apply at Bosch? How did you get the internship at Bosch? How did it turn into a placement?</strong></p><p>When it comes to design placements, it's a different ball game for industrial designers compared to engineering students in our college. Industrial design placements don't follow the same structured process as engineering placements. For us, our portfolio is our best asset.</p><p>You have to work hard to be above average. Only 20% of industrial design students in India get placed. Only 2- 4% of them will have their dream jobs. The industry doesn't have a high demand for industrial designers, and design studios are usually closely knit. I realized these realities from my first year of college onwards. I understood what the industry demands and what it's all about. I knew I wanted to pursue industrial design and nothing else. I focused solely on industrial design and didn't waste my time on other subjects. Instead, I dedicated myself to product design, creating physical objects and prototypes. I studied the works of the best industrial designers in India and beyond, trying to match their portfolios and understand what they did during their college years. I built my own portfolio, even though at that time, I had only one project while others had three or four. But with that portfolio, I applied to Tata Elexsi, and luckily, I got an internship there. It was a great starting point for me, and I'm still in touch with my Tata Elexsi mentor.</p><p>During my internship, I gained real-world experience and learned how the industry works. I understood what it takes to succeed and what doesn't work. I made significant changes to my portfolio, aligning it with industry expectations. I took a break for six months after Tata Elexsi, during which I focused on personal projects and enhancing my skills. I also won several awards, including some international recognition, which helped me gain visibility.</p><p>One key factor in this industry is that the industry doesn't come to you; you have to reach out to them. You can't rely on job portals; you need to personally contact people in design studios. You have to introduce yourself, share your portfolio, and ask for a portfolio review. If they like your work, they may offer you a job or an interview. It's simple and straightforward, but also quite challenging because most of your emails may go unanswered. But persistence is key. I extensively used LinkedIn to find professionals working in companies like Bosch, Ether, Frog Design, Samsung, and more. I must have sent over 800 cold emails, introducing myself and sharing my work. Out of those, I received around 20 to 22 replies, which is a good response rate. I had interviews with those who replied, and I managed to secure internships and job opportunities through these connections.</p><p>For most of these interviews, it didn't feel like a typical interview. They were more interested in getting to know me and my capabilities rather than grilling me with questions. I believe it was because they had already seen my work and knew me through the design community. So, it was just a matter of reaching out to them and expressing my need for an internship or job.</p><p>Networking is crucial in this industry. You need to join design communities like Young Designers India and engage with other designers. Attend design events and conferences, and make connections. It's all about being confident and showcasing your professionalism. Your portfolio should speak for itself and reflect all the hard work you've put into it.</p><p>In addition to the internship at Bosch, I received a full-time scholarship for an industrial design cohort called Offsite, conducted by an American design agency called Advanced Design. I managed to balance my internship at bosch during the day and Offsite classes during the night, applying the knowledge gained from the course to my internship projects</p><p>Lastly, I want to emphasise that internships in design are not like typical internships. When you join as an intern, they give you substantial responsibilities and expect you to take ownership of projects. You'll be treated as a professional, not just an intern. So, it's important to be prepared and showcase your skills and willingness to learn.</p><p>That's pretty much my journey and what I learned throughout the placement process. It's competitive, but with the right mindset, a killer portfolio, and a proactive approach to networking, you can increase your chances of success.</p><p><strong>Did you have any amusing rejections during your placement journey? How did you bounce back from those moments?</strong></p><p>Yes, I faced several setbacks during my placement journey as a designer. In interviews, some people simply didn't like my work without any explanation. It was a matter of personal taste. I couldn't defend my design decisions effectively, and that's where I went wrong.</p><p>There was a lot of uncertainty and anxiety when choosing between multiple job offers. I had to weigh different factors like pay and workplace environment. I had zero professional experience and wanted to make a good start in the industry. I applied to many European design studios through cold mailing, and I received responses from some of them, including Teams Design, a renowned design agency in Germany. However, due to bureaucracy and visa issues, I couldn't accept their offer.</p><p>Another disappointment came from BSH (Bosch Siemens Home Appliances). After interning with Bosch, I applied to BSH and surprisingly received replies from all three designers I contacted. They were impressed with my work but wanted to know more about my design decisions. Unfortunately, the visa process became a major obstacle, and despite multiple attempts, I couldn't secure the necessary documentation.</p><p>Although I had a job offer from Bosch, I continued searching for better opportunities. It was challenging to deal with these rejections, especially when circumstances were beyond my control. I felt helpless because I knew I deserved to be there, but I couldn't overcome the bureaucratic hurdles.</p><p>To cope with the disappointments, I reached out to my connections and received internship offers from Samsung Design Delhi and Frog, a global design agency with a studio in India. However, I realised that these opportunities didn't align with my ambitious goals for my graduation project. Ultimately, I decided to intern at Ather, a dynamic company where I felt a strong connection and energy.</p><p>Currently, I have a job offer from Bosch, which is highly lucrative and exciting. However, I'm still looking for something that truly resonates with me. If everything goes as planned, I'll be in Munich soon. Otherwise, I'll start my job with Bosch in Bangalore, which is also a great opportunity. These disappointments are a part of my journey, but they fuel my determination to find the right path for myself.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest learnings that you have applied to your design practice? And what advice would you give to aspiring designers?</strong></p><p>One of the major learnings I gained from my internships is the importance of approaching challenges with honesty, naivety, and optimism. Each designer in my batch had their own unique ideas and ways of thinking, so it's crucial to find your own approach while also following a structured and linear process.</p><p>I faced a technical issue during a client presentation when my internet was unreliable. My mentor had to step in and handle the situation. From that experience, I learned the significance of double-checking everything, from your internet connection to your tools, to avoid any embarrassing or setback-inducing situations. Taking proactive measures to ensure your systems are running smoothly can save you a lot of trouble.</p><p>Another lesson I learned was the value of saying no to projects. As designers, we tend to be eager to take on multiple projects simultaneously. However, it's essential to assess each project's potential value and impact on your portfolio and creative bandwidth. Learning to decline projects that won't contribute significantly allows you to focus on delivering quality work and achieving better outcomes.</p><p>Note-taking is another critical aspect that I realized during my internships. Initially, I thought I could rely on my memory, but working on multiple projects made it evident that details can slip away easily. Taking comprehensive notes during meetings, client discussions, and interviews became a habit that helped me stay organized and prevented me from forgetting important information.</p><p>Improving my interpersonal skills was a significant area of growth for me. As an introvert, initiating conversations and engaging with colleagues didn't come naturally. However, I soon realised the importance of building relationships and effective communication in a design studio. Taking the initiative to connect with others, sharing more about myself, and showing genuine interest in their lives helped me develop stronger connections and created a more collaborative environment.</p><p>Utilising weekends for personal projects was something I discovered during my internships. Many companies are open to allowing interns to use their resources for personal projects. I took advantage of this opportunity and worked on my own ideas during weekends. It not only allowed me to explore new concepts but also garnered interest from colleagues and mentors who provided valuable guidance and mentorship.</p><p>Speaking of mentors, learning from experienced designers was invaluable. I actively sought guidance, participated in projects, and observed their techniques. Building a strong relationship with my mentors provided additional learning experiences and helped me grow as a designer.</p><p>Finally, I learned the importance of learning about people in a design studio. Each person has their unique passions and hobbies. By connecting with colleagues and finding common ground, I could learn from their interests and build stronger relationships. This opened up avenues for knowledge sharing and collaboration.</p><p>So, my advice to aspiring designers would be to approach challenges with honesty, embrace naivety and optimism, double-check technical aspects, learn to say no to projects that don't align with your goals, take comprehensive notes, work on personal projects during weekends if possible, actively seek guidance from mentors, improve interpersonal skills, and learn from the diverse passions of colleagues. By applying these learnings, aspiring designers can enhance their design practice and make the most of their internships</p><p><strong>Which skills helped you succeed as a designer?</strong></p><p>Industrial design is very hands-on, so in my portfolio, you'll see a lot of renderings and action prototypes. I've always been inclined towards physically building things, so I emphasise the importance of prototyping skills. From the beginning of college, I started building things by hand. Even without proper tools, I learned a lot from YouTube videos, like those from Adam Savage on Tested. I watched these videos to learn how to use different tools and make things work. As I gained access to resources during internships and college, I mastered the tools required for prototyping. So, keeping your prototyping skills strong is crucial.</p><p>Knowing materials is another valuable skill. I've always had a passion for learning and crafting, so I realized you can create amazing prototypes using materials that are readily available, even waste materials. For example, a shampoo bottle at home can become a good grip for a drill machine. So, I encourage aspiring designers to try quick and dirty prototyping and make the most of the resources around them.</p><p>Being a good reader is essential too. You don't have to be a nerdy kid like me, but you should keep yourself updated and aware of what's happening in the industry. The field of design is constantly evolving, and you need to adapt to different user demographics, use cases, and product types. While you can specialise in certain areas like medical product design or automotive industrial design, it's important to remain flexible and have a broad awareness of the industry. There are plenty of online blogs, YouTube videos, and LinkedIn posts by experienced designers that you can learn from and stay updated.</p><p>Knowing your software tools is also crucial, but you don't have to learn every single software out there. In my case, I focused on mastering Fusion 360 for 3D modelling, Photoshop for post-processing, and KeyShot for rendering. These are the digital software tools that are relevant to my work. You should identify the essential software tools for your area of specialisation and become proficient in using them. You don't need to know ten different software programs; just focus on mastering a few.</p><p>Sketching is another skill that I highly recommend. In the early years of college, I didn't think sketching was important, but I was wrong. You don't have to create fancy, Instagram-worthy sketches. Simple doodles and line drawings are enough to communicate your ideas effectively. Sketching helps you visualise and convey your thoughts and is an essential part of the design thinking process. Start with simple sketches and gradually develop your sketching skills.</p><p>Lastly, even if you're an introvert, it's important to learn how to present yourself and communicate your ideas. Developing a strong personality and improving your presentation skills will help you advocate for your designs and get your ideas across effectively. Seek feedback from others and work on refining your presentation style. Remember, the industry pays you for your skills initially, so keep practising and honing your skills. As you progress in your career, you'll also be paid for your ability to think strategically and come up with innovative ideas.</p><p><strong>We've noticed a growing trend of design students shifting towards interaction design. Why do you think that is? And how have you managed to stick with product design and excel in it?</strong></p><p>Well, when I started at DTU, there were about 15 to 18 people interested in industrial design. By the end of the first year, that number had decreased to around 12. And now, in my fourth year, there are only four or five of us working as industrial designers. The rest have shifted to other fields. The reason behind this decline is that industrial design is demanding and challenging.</p><p>To succeed in industrial design, you need a wide range of skills. It starts with identifying the right problem and understanding the needs of the users. The entire journey can be mentally and physically exhausting if you're not passionate about it. It requires dedication and the willingness to give it your all. You might have to work over weekends and push yourself to the limits. Industrial design demands a lot from you, from hands-on work like prototyping and testing to maintaining creative rigour and generating fresh ideas consistently.</p><p>It's not a job for everyone. It's like biking—some people are content with a regular scooter for their everyday needs, while others crave the thrill of riding a high-performance superbike. It all comes down to passion. Some designers pursue industrial design purely out of passion, while others love the process of building and managing projects. They become skilled designers who also excel at leading and coordinating teams.</p><p>Regarding interaction design, from what I've observed, many people mistakenly associate interaction design with designing screens for mobile phones or other devices. But interaction design is much broader than that. It involves the interaction between the human senses and something physical or virtual, regardless of screen size. For example, interacting with the exterior of a car or using a unique typewriter merged with digital technology.</p><p>Unfortunately, many individuals in the field of interaction design lack a deep understanding of what it truly entails. Only a small percentage of them truly grasp the essence of interaction design and produce exceptional work. I have great respect for those who excel in this field.</p><p>Now, to address why more students are shifting towards interaction design, I believe there are several factors at play. Firstly, interaction design offers a more predictable and structured career path. The tools and patterns are well-established, making it easier to make an impact. Secondly, India is predominantly a software economy, so there is a greater demand for software designers. Job opportunities in interaction design are abundant compared to industrial design, especially for fresh graduates. Lastly, there is the allure of higher-paying jobs in the interaction design field.</p><p>However, it's important to note that if you excel in industrial design and produce outstanding work, you can also enjoy equal or even better remuneration. The key is to showcase your best work and stand out from the competition.</p><p>Ultimately, it's a personal choice. Shifting to interaction design is perfectly fine if you feel it suits you better or if you're drawn to its advantages. I have chosen to stick with product design because I'm passionate about it and find fulfilment in this field. My motivation lies in creating meaningful physical products, and I'm content with my decision.</p><p><strong>How was your experience publishing a research paper in your second year?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, it's interesting because publishing a research paper in my second year of college was quite an achievement. However, as someone who has been working in the industry for a while now, I wouldn't prioritise it as much. But yes, I'm still quite passionate about reading and writing. I have written several articles and research papers that I haven't published yet, but I enjoy the process.</p><p>Actually, my first research paper was not in college but back in ninth grade. It was for the Indian International Science Festival organised by the Ministry of Scientists. The event was open to everyone, from school kids to PhD students and researchers. I always had a keen interest in science and wanted to work in scientific fields, although my maths skills weren't strong enough to pursue a scientific career. However, my school mentor, who had a strong academic background and had previously worked as a research scientist, motivated me to participate in the festival. He guided me through the process, and I ended up writing and submitting a paper. Looking back, it may not have had much value, but it was a significant accomplishment for me at the time.</p><p>When I entered college, I was determined to become a college professor and teach industrial design. I was very research-oriented and still am. I always keep myself updated by reading a lot of research papers regularly. It's like how some people read manga or comic books—I find reading research papers fascinating. Even in the field of industrial design, there are many research papers that provide valuable insights and methods. Institutions like MIT Media Lab and Technical University offer excellent research in design. So my advice would be to read a lot of research papers and familiarise yourself with the work of other researchers. This will help you distinguish between good and bad research, just like how watching many movies allows you to judge their quality.</p><p>If you aspire to publish a research paper, my recommendation would be to look for existing research on the topic you're interested in. Chances are, someone else has already explored it. Reach out to college seniors or search for content online to see if others have encountered similar problems or have valuable insights. Learn from other people's work and develop your own perspective based on that foundation.</p><p>For design research specifically, it's important to understand how it differs from research in other fields like engineering or physical sciences. Look for the best design researchers in the field, both in India and internationally. Manchu Bhagavad is one prominent researcher I can recommend. Also, explore the work of designers who combine research with industry practice, such as Arvin Sanjeev. By studying their papers, you can gain a better understanding of how to approach research as a designer and add your own unique perspective to the traditional research paper format.</p><p><strong>What upcoming fields can designers work on to gain an advantage in their careers?</strong></p><p>I once asked an influential person the same question, expressing concerns about industrial designers moving towards interaction design and whether it's something to worry about. He assured me that as long as people need physical products like toilet seats and spoons, there will always be a demand for industrial designers. The introduction of AI doesn't eliminate jobs but rather creates new opportunities. For example, knowing how to use a smartphone or a computer used to be a valuable skill, but now it's commonplace. So, you need to constantly upgrade your skills to stay ahead.</p><p>One field to explore is digital interfaces, as the convergence of physical and digital experiences is becoming more prevalent. It's not enough to just claim to be an interdisciplinary designer; you should showcase your abilities through a diverse portfolio that includes both physical and digital projects. Traditional design disciplines like visual design, interaction design, and industrial design still have value, but it's important to prepare for the future. Consider the interfaces we'll need in the next 20 or 30 years and focus on that.</p><p>Medical design is an emerging field that many companies are shifting towards. For example, Philips, known for consumer products like trimmers and homogenizers, generates less than 20% of its revenue from those products. They are investing more in healthcare devices, medical equipment, and software. Even Bosch, a hardware manufacturer, is transitioning towards software and embedded systems. As an interaction designer, upgrading your skills to specialise in industrial applications of interaction design could be a strategic move.</p><p>Observing industry trends is also crucial. Analyse platforms like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) over the years to understand the product evolution and where the industry is headed. You'll notice a focus on medical products, the digital economy, and companies integrating software into their operations. It's not just about screens but about managing entire systems through software, such as fleet management or workforce coordination.</p><p>In summary, upcoming fields to explore include medical design and the integration of software in traditionally hardware-focused industries. Stay updated with industry trends and position yourself for the future by upgrading your skills accordingly.</p><p><strong>What are your future goals, considering your successful placement and current work?</strong></p><p>I have both short-term and long-term goals. In the long term, I see myself teaching industrial design to students. However, that will happen around ten to fifteen years from now, once I have gained more industry experience. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and tricks with others, so I already mentor students occasionally. But actively teaching would be my focus in the future.</p><p>In the short term, I have a goal to visit Europe and Japan. These two places are known for their design excellence, especially in industrial design. Brands like Sony from Japan and companies like Braun from Germany have iconic products that are often featured in textbooks. So, I want to experience the design culture there and learn what sets them apart. I believe it will broaden my perspective and expose me to more mature and defined design practices. Learning German and Japanese would also be beneficial for an industrial designer.</p><p>Once I have gathered these experiences, my plan is to return to India and work for an Indian brand. That's my short-term goal. Additionally, I have a personal aspiration to pursue a master's degree. I have always wanted to do it even before entering this field. In the short term, I aim to work for a design studio or apprentice under a European, Canadian, or Japanese designer to further enhance my skills.</p><p>So, in summary, my dream job is to become a college professor in the long term, while in the short term, I want to gain international exposure, work for an Indian brand, and pursue a master's degree.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Kartik Tomar, COE, Class of 2023 who has received an offer from Uber for a Software Development role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>When did you decide that you wanted to apply for an SDE role and when did you start preparing?</strong></p><p>Around the 2nd semester of the first year, I found out that DSA is a major requirement for the SDE roles, which most people go for, so I started doing DSA, going from easy to harder problems. I achieved about 6 stars on HackerRank, I then moved onto doing LeetCode questions and solving questions on Codeforces. In the start I wasn’t even able to solve a single problem, but I kept solving and revising. From the start of 2nd year, I started giving contests on CodeChef with focus also on LeetCode. I think around the end of 2nd year I started doing LeetCode contests as well. Rather than first studying the concepts I would start with the problem and if I faced any difficulty then I just revise the concept. You have to majorly solve problems and give contests as well.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through your internship application and interview journey? What advice would you like to give to students who are preparing for their intern interviews right now?</strong></p><p>I applied through an off-campus opportunity. I already had an intern offer from CureFit but I was not satisfied with it. In the first week of January 2022, I found a job posting on LinkedIn. At that time, I was not expecting to get any interview call or get shortlisted. After 1 week I got the online assessment link, and then subsequently I got the interview notification. I had 3 interviews, all of them were scheduled on the same day. The first 2 interviews were technical, and the 3rd was managerial. In the technical rounds I was asked questions surrounding brute force solutions with follow up questions. The interviewers help you a lot, you are not alone. It was the first time I was given questions on low-level designing, but they gave hints to follow up on.</p><p>The advice I would like to give is, nervousness is ok, but you are not alone, the interviewer will help you, follow the tips they are giving, and communicate your thinking process properly. Whenever you find an off-campus opportunity, try to ask for a referral but apply as soon as possible as some companies just take an X amount of people who applied first.</p><p><strong>Were there any hilarious or unforgettable moments during your preparation?</strong></p><p>I lived in a PG at the end of first year, my roommate also wanted to crack a SDE job, so we started with HackerRank. We jumped to CodeChef and opened a graph problem without even knowing what it is. Forget about solving it, we didn’t even know what it was. So, we started studying graphs and doing various problems. But we got so demotivated because we couldn’t understand it at all, and we left DSA for 1 month. It’s not exactly hilarious but it’s something I remember.</p><p><strong>You mentioned that you did not have any referral while applying for an off-campus opportunity, what was the highlight in your resume?</strong></p><p>According to me there wasn’t anything specifically exceptional highlighted on my resume, but I feel like I had decent projects and some good experience, what I think most companies do is that they just take the X number of candidates who applied the earliest. If you do 2-3 decent projects and some internships, it gives you an upper hand.</p><p><strong>You may have faced some setbacks and been rejected, would you like to share some of those with us and how you overcame them?</strong></p><p>D.E. Shaw was the first interview I gave, but after 1 round I was rejected as they asked questions about OOPS which I couldn’t answer. After that I felt very demotivated, but then realized I could either cry or start preparing for the next rounds. After that I had my Sprinklr interviews, I gave 2 rounds, but I wasn’t even told about my rejection, so I felt very demotivated after this as well. After was the interview for Microsoft, but even after 3 rounds I wasn’t shortlisted. I was able to crack the CureFit interview. What happens is that if you are shortlisted in a company and if you have worked hard, you will get what you deserve. Don’t fear setbacks or rejections, life happens. But even after CureFit I wasn’t satisfied, so I applied for Uber. I was very happy at the end, and I didn’t even remember everything that happened because even if I cracked the previous interviews, I would’ve left them for Uber as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What general advice would you like to give to your juniors to ace their placement preparation?</strong></p><p>The first thing would be to focus on your CGPA, don’t focus too much so that you are only studying for college. Many a time CGPA is the shortlisting criteria, try to aim for a good CGPA of 9 or above. The next thing I would suggest is to try to give contests regularly, don’t worry about decreasing rankings because what matters is your skill, the interviewer will not shortlist you on your ranking but rather on your skillset. Keep doing DSA regularly, you will not be a master of DSA at any point of time, it is a long process, and you have to continuously practice. Solving problems and doing contests regularly is a good habit.</p><p><strong>What unique skills or qualities make a candidate stand out to the employer? Could you give some examples from your own case?</strong></p><p>The first thing is you should be able to take feedback, be open to whatever your interviewer or colleague is telling you. The next thing is to always keep learning, you can always learn something from someone. And especially for the interview, always communicate what you are writing or thinking so that the interviewer can help you out.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Shashank Parmar, SE, Class of 2023, who got offers from Codenation and Visa for a Software Developer position.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>What was your approach to placement preparation?</strong></p><p>My preparation for placements began with focus close to the end of my first year. While I was in my first year, I gained some knowledge in web development and actively participated in various societies, although I eventually left most of them. However, it was towards the end of the first year that I started my actual preparation for data structures and algorithms. Fortunately, since both opportunities were on campus, I didn't have to go through a job portal. We had a convenient DTU RM app where we could apply to different companies. Unfortunately, I made a mistake by solely focusing on projects, data structures, and algorithms, neglecting important subjects like operating systems, object-oriented programming, and computer networks. This oversight cost me several opportunities, such as cracking interviews with companies like Sprinklr, Intuit, and Atlassian, as I wasn't proficient in those subjects.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to candidates preparing for placement interviews?</strong></p><p>I believe it's crucial for candidates preparing for interviews to strike a healthy balance between developing their resume, studying algorithms, and covering the course curriculum. Each aspect deserves equal attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, I'd like to share a humorous incident related to projects. During the second half of my first year, I focused primarily on projects. However, as I progressed, I shifted my focus solely to algorithms and data structures. This approach posed a challenge when I was in interviews and completely forgot about my web development experience, despite mentioning it on my resume. In an interview with Sprinklr, the interviewer, who happened to be a front-end developer, noticed the project section on my resume. He started questioning me about it, and even though I had worked on those projects myself, I had forgotten the intricate details. He even asked if I had copied them from the internet. It was an embarrassing situation, and I couldn't make the most of those projects. This experience taught me the importance of continuous studying as a means to bounce back from such setbacks.</p><p><strong>Can you share an instance where you successfully overcame a lack of proficiency in certain subjects?</strong></p><p>There was a point when I realised I had made mistakes in operating systems and DBMS. To rectify this, I dedicated myself to studying those subjects thoroughly and reappeared for interviews. This effort paid off, as I was able to successfully pass those interviews. Through this process, I developed a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I realised the significance of understanding the underlying concepts and technologies when working on projects in any field. Interviewers often delve deep into project details, so it's crucial to have a deep understanding of the chosen tech stack. Alongside this, studying subjects taught in college, such as DBMS, operating systems, computer networks, and object-oriented programming, proved to be instrumental not only for interviews but also for becoming a well-rounded software engineer.</p><p><strong>What qualities do you believe set a candidate apart during interviews?</strong></p><p>The ability to effectively express projects, ideas, and solutions is vital. While many candidates may have impressive projects and a strong understanding of algorithms, what truly matters is how well they can communicate their thought process to the interviewer. Effective communication is key. Even if a candidate doesn't arrive at the correct solution, the clarity and coherence with which they convey their thought process can make them stand out. Let me share an incident from my interview at Uber. During the data structures and algorithms round, I couldn't solve the entire problem. However, I was able to progress to the next round because I presented a rudimentary solution and effectively communicated my approach. Although it wasn't the ideal solution, my strong communication skills played a significant role in advancing me to the next stage.</p><p><strong>What sparked your fascination with machine learning and deep learning?</strong></p><p>Over the past year, I've developed a profound fascination with the field of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm working on several research projects and have a strong desire to pursue this field as a career. The combination of mathematics and algorithms involved in machine learning is what captivates me. Unlike traditional data structures and algorithms problems, where an exact solution is sought, machine learning offers constant room for improvement through mathematical skills and algorithmic thinking. There's always the opportunity to enhance solutions, and there isn't a single correct answer. This dynamic aspect of machine learning truly intrigues me.</p><p><strong>Considering your interest in machine learning, how do you envision incorporating it into your future career?</strong></p><p>While I'm deeply passionate about machine learning and deep learning, I haven't made a concrete decision about how I'll incorporate them into my future career. Currently, my plan is to continue my job and simultaneously explore opportunities in this field. I'm open to the possibility of pursuing a Master's degree in order to further develop my expertise. The combination of mathematics and algorithms in machine learning aligns perfectly with my interests. The fact that there's no single correct answer and that continuous improvement is possible through mathematical skills and algorithmic thinking is what excites me the most. As I explore more possibilities, I'll make a more informed decision regarding my future path.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Abhigyan Adarsh, EE, Class of 2023, who got an offer from Qualcomm in their Hardware vertical.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you decide on applying for hardware-related roles? Did you face any setbacks?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It was from the end of the second year when I committed myself toward this by learning the skills and the test experiences of my seniors. I got this inspiration from my seniors. I worked in a technical team, IEEE DTU, and also with Inferno where my seniors are doing internships in hardware companies. I also got intrigued with these roles as they do not require much coding which I was bad at but more electrical and electronics background. I was enthusiastic about electronics and I wanted to pursue it. That's why I chose this option and took on the preparation for the hardware roles in general for the placement as well as an internship at the end of the second year.&nbsp;</p><p>For the initial phase during my internship season, I was not able to clear the interviews of companies because of the lack of practice so I couldn't compete in those scenarios. I was sure of these things in placement seasons where I was very focused on practising and clearing the concepts and also sharing questions that are designed and shared by our seniors with us. These setbacks of not clearing the tests brought a kind of practice environment for me where I can learn from my past and bounce back in the placement season where I could clear more tests than internship season. During the first interview experience, I got to know how the interview process works in real life and I was sure of these mistakes that I made in the past and could rectify them in the second opportunity I got with Qualcomm.</p><p><strong>How was your interview experience with Google and Qualcomm for Hardware roles?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>During the placement season, I was able to crack Google's hardware test. We had 3 interview rounds. The first round was coding. The second one was core electronics and some logical questions. Then the third round was a ramp-up round with HR questions mixed with technical questions. It was basically a domain-specific interview. The interviewer was eager to know whether I was inclined towards analog or digital. Unfortunately, I couldn't go through the final selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I gave the interviews for Qualcomm. There were just 2 rounds. The first one was about digital electronics and logical reasoning puzzles. The second round was about Verilog, resume and HR-related questions. Finally, I got a call from HR and they asked me what I wanted to pursue in the future and how long I would be able to dedicate myself to the company.</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for students looking to get into a hardware-related job?</strong></p><p>Google requires good work experience, either in the project domain or internships. They get to know your skills from that. For other companies, they look into your projects and skills which you gain throughout your college years. They are more concerned with your academics. You need to maintain a good CGPA. Focus on Verilog, digital electronics and also practise puzzles for the academic side. For the resume, except for Google, you need to have a pretty standard resume with a Verilog project to be a must, for Google specific you should have some good experience with projects.&nbsp;</p><p>For the non-academic side of things, you need to have good communication skills and the ability to propagate your idea to others properly. Co-curricular activities are an important part of your overall development, so you should have a good co-curricular life as well where you can participate in things be it a society or a tech team.&nbsp;</p><p>The interviews are pretty standard; they just focus on your good understanding. All of the tests are hardcore digital and analog questions that you need to practise from the second year when you learn them in college. The second thing would be during the interview process, they just need to know how good you are at the things you practised for the test. They actually ask questions from your academics and they see the understanding of basics. So, you need to have good practice and the basics should be clear. You need to be focused just for 2-3 months to practise and to clear your concepts. If you practise, focus, and study for 3-4 months as we did in our JEE days, that's enough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who do you think played a major role in your success with placements?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I greatly respect my seniors for all the efforts which they put into training us. Right from the second year, our seniors were really helpful in answering any questions or taking sessions in fact for us in the placements and internship opportunities and also taught us about industry standards and what all the companies wanted. I would greatly thank my seniors for their support in this journey of 1.5 years where they supported us throughout the internship as well as placement season.</p><p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p><p>I would surely love to explore this corporate world. The <i>chalta hai</i> attitude does not really work in the corporate world. In college, delaying work is not a big problem. But in a company, if you are assigned a task, you need to do it. If someone asks about your progress, you can’t delay the reply if you haven't done it. If you're running a delay, you should be transparent.&nbsp;</p><p>My immediate goal is to learn more in hardware—chip designing, robotics, analog and digital stuff. When we were in college, it was just “hardware or software”, but here, hardware is very diverse.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Anusha Barman, EE, Class of 2023, who got an offer from BlackRock for the Analyst profile.&nbsp;</strong></i><br><br><strong>Please tell us about your placement journey and how you prepared.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Since this offer is in the non-tech domain, there are certain topics you need to prepare yourself with. I had started preparing Python and pandas about a year prior to my placement season in order to establish a base. Then in the last two months before placement season, I started to really catch up and polish my resume. I made some standard projects which are required for entering non-tech domains, for example, exploratory data analysis. I also studied the basics of ML. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Please tell us about your recruitment experience with Blackrock. &nbsp;</strong><br><br>BlackRock conducted a resume screening test and then an interview. In my resume, I had mentioned taking up a course called Financial Statement Analysis in my 2nd year which covered the fundamental aspects of finance. I think that helped my resume get shortlisted and also helped me in my interview.&nbsp;<br><br>In the interview round, the panellists were really warm, so, I guess I was a bit lucky in that sense, since some people get really rude interviewers. In an interview, it is really important to be yourself. Your unique experiences and skill sets distinguish you from the other candidates. To be honest, most of the questions that they had asked me were really standard. I was just being honest to them and not exaggerating any of my skills.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Were you sure of which companies you wanted to target? How did you bounce back from the rejections prior to getting into BlackRock?&nbsp;</strong><br><br><br>I was really particular about the companies I wanted to sit for. I had an Excel sheet that included the names of the Big4, American Express, BlackRock and others. I had initially decided to target these companies and I had planned to lower the bar if that plan would not have worked out.&nbsp;<br><br>To deal with rejections, I had tried to instil some faith in myself since I knew there were still more companies. It wouldn't have made sense to feel dejected before September since that would've just hampered my progress and prevented me from getting into the companies I had targeted.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What advice would you give to students preparing for similar roles?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Practise your communication skills in front of the mirror—that would help to present your ideas more freely. In the non-tech domain, the most popular questions are generally about walking through your resume and telling about yourself. So you must make sure you are well versed with all the details of your resume and you are ready for these questions before-hand. Also, you must highlight the keywords in your resume.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do you have any hilarious anecdotes or weird pre-interview rituals?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I remember the initial few companies were the renowned tech giants like Google and Microsoft and I didn't sit for the placement rounds of any of them, my friends were like “Anusha, why don't you sit for tech companies? It is easier for girls”. I felt that it might be easy for girls who have a good amount of technical knowledge and skills, but that was not me! I am not interested in coding [laughs]. &nbsp;<br><br>Before every interview, I liked to make sure that I was happy with the way I looked. I used to spend a good amount of time taking a bath, drying my hair and getting ready for the interview. I remember I had a really good hair day at the time of my interview, being at my best helped me to focus entirely on the interview and not on the external factors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>During your company visit, what did you find the culture of BlackRock to be like? Is it like a LoFi song or is it like a loud orchestra?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I think it is inclined more towards the LoFi side. All the panellists I had spoken to were very knowledgeable yet also very respectful. They were welcoming and eager to have me on board. The experiences of others that I have read about online also seem really good.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What are your future plans?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>My end goal is to either work independently or have my own firm. I feel like I am really good at managing money and helping people with their finances, but before that, I suppose I need to create impact and that is what I am looking to do in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Anu Singh Lather, Vice-Chancellor, Ambedkar University, Delhi. Read on as she shares her highly inspirational and impactful journey and talks about how to blend technology and leadership together to bear the best results.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><strong>You</strong><i> </i><strong>have been affiliated with a number of prestigious institutes across the country and each role is a testament to your leadership ability and administrative expertise. Based on your experiences, what characteristics do you think set a leader apart?</strong></p><p>Furthermore, I think that leaders need to be more tech-savvy and their agendas must be related to the practicality of the world. We are faced with a diverse set of issues, be it the sensitive ones regarding the social fabric of society or simply the need to include the marginalised communities. So, even leaders need to develop a broad mind set along the way as well as connect to the people at grassroot level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What hallmarks of an institute in your opinion makes it a more distinguished and exceptional institution as compared to other institutions of the country and the world?</strong></p><p>Contemporary pedagogy should be field based i.e. you have to be connected with the field and the community. Moreover, an institution can play an even more significant role in society by providing financial help to the students in need along with sharing resources and facilities with neighbouring universities.</p><p><strong>Talking about Internationalisation of Education, how do you feel student exchange programs and academic partnerships with foreign universities can also benefit us?</strong></p><p>Also, these MOUs are very important in the upcoming times for India as a nation and we, as leaders, are also trying to emphasise this as much as possible. For instance, ICCR is giving a big platform to economically backward nations to send their students here and that too almost on a freeship. In return, Indian students also get to travel at a very subsidised amount across the world and that has brought about a big difference.</p><p><strong>While the majority of teachers in our schools are female, the picture of Higher Education is strikingly opposite. What are the causes behind this situation and what shall be done to improve this ratio?</strong></p><p>Another concerning factor is the female dropout rate in our country which ultimately prevents more female students from pursuing higher education. This also needs to be taken care of more seriously, especially at the school level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It has been observed that research in educational institutions is still limited to research papers, citations and journals, which in turn obscures their potential applications in the industry. What steps shall be taken to ensure that the outcomes of these possible practical applications and the research, that is conducted in these institutions, reaches industries and other organisations, be it government or private, more effectively?</strong></p><p>Furthermore, I believe that the connection to the community is also very important otherwise your curriculum and follow up research will make no sense. To deal with this issue more pragmatically, what we can possibly do is we should take up the research projects coming from the industry, so that their relevance is guaranteed. But for this to happen, the industry should open up first. I hope that since the New Education Policy (NEP)&nbsp; has been introduced by the government with a lot of deliberation, it might make some difference in the domain of research as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talking about industrial application, entrepreneurship is something that cannot be taught in classrooms. You played a pivotal role in establishing the DTU’s East Campus i.e. University School of Management and Entrepreneurship. How does U.S.M.E facilitate entrepreneurship?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We also decided to introduce a 2-year MBA in Family Business which, at that time, was being offered only as a diploma or an elective course in other institutions. The main reason behind that was to connect people from small and middle-class industrial belts with the institution.&nbsp;</p><p>For a long time, we wanted to start a B-School in Eastern Delhi which also received support from the government. After all, entrepreneurship is the future of our country, so it made sense to have a school that completely focussed on that. While setting up the institution and deciding upon the curriculum that was to be taught, we connected with those in the relevant industries and had marathon meetings with them regarding college’s programs.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a case as seen in our nation and in other developing nations where the researches are more theoretical in nature or they just present repetitive kinds of work. This sort of poor orientation comes from the fact that we introduce research much later in the life of the scholar than it should have been introduced. To change that, we did the experiment, in DTU itself, with the introduction of the research project work at UG levels and that made a difference in terms of their publications, etc.&nbsp;<br>When you look at the female representation in the social sciences domain, you will find that the number is very encouraging. In my university itself, we have about 64 percent female students and almost 50 percent female faculty. But these numbers also depend on the nature of the courses offered at an institute. For example, in technological institutes, we will always find a dearth of girls subscribing to technology-based programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Since I have had the experience of leading the International Affairs office in my parent university, I believe that resources will always be limited so we need to develop mechanisms to optimally use them. That’s why international exposure and student exchanges are happening across the globe wherein good universities approach each other and sign MOUs for student exchange for a period of time. Undoubtedly,&nbsp; students get the most benefits through such programs as they do not have to pay from their pockets while travelling and staying at other institutions.</p><p>First and foremost, it’s the quality of students, who are taking admissions in these institutions, that makes all the difference. This is because their expectations from the system, their contributions to the society, and their awareness about the changes and transformations in their surroundings are the factors that drive institutions towards greatness. Furthermore, an institutions’ prestige is also measured by its faculty and its quality in terms of their profile. Nevertheless, in today’s time, the profile is not about degrees they have acquired, it's about how they can teach their students by depicting the connection between reality, conflicts, and the challenges.</p><p>I believe we are in a transition from the previous traditional systems to a more technology-driven society, so leadership has definitely become far more challenging these days. However, I firmly believe that the social and emotional skills that drove the leaders in the past will still drive them in the future. After all, to avoid becoming irrelevant as a leader, you need to evolve in every aspect and in order to do so, one would always need traditional skills and competence.&nbsp;</p>",

As engineering is a professional career, if you want to excel in a profession you should plan it and put your efforts into achievement. You have a multifaceted scope of growth impact in the engineering profession”</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Prof. Madhusudan Singh, Registrar, DTU, unveils the Registrar's office impact on educational reform and shares insights from years at the University in an exclusive interview with DTU Times.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Can you describe your vision for the future of engineering education in India and how DTU is working to achieve that?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, the Indian engineering education system is going through a major transformation after the implementation of the new education policy in 2020, which emphasizes mainly on multidisciplinary education systems. That's why most of the reputed engineering and other institutions are orienting themselves towards multidisciplinary nature. If you have noticed, even Delhi Technological University (DTU) in the past six to seven years has started programs in other disciplines, other than engineering, such as Bachelor of Design, other management programs, and allied areas like BA Economics, BBA programs. This is an effort to create a comprehensive university where all kinds of studies are offered, giving students the opportunity to study other areas as well, apart from their own discipline, which is usually called a major. The discipline in which you are admitted is your major, and if you want to study a discipline other than your major, you can opt for those courses through a minor area of study. DTU has already introduced this provision of a minor in 2020, even before the announcement of NEP 2020. The first batch with a minor specialization is going to graduate this year. Some provisions of NEP are already implemented in DTU, and we are trying to implement the remaining provisions through our new curriculum, which has already been designed and approved by our academic council for the forthcoming B.Tech batch. This broadly outlines the future of engineering education, and there are many provisions in NEP that we are working on implementing in a phased manner. One provision, as I mentioned, is multidisciplinary education, for which the minor will be helpful. Another provision is for multiple entry and multiple exit. In a four-year program, there must be ways to enter the system at different levels and plan for different exit points with certifications and degrees. These provisions are already made in our new curriculum, which is going to be implemented from the upcoming session in 2023.</p><p><strong>DTU has a huge faculty base. How do you ensure that all the faculty members remain up to date and engage with the latest developments in their respective fields of study?</strong></p><p>Keeping knowledge updated is a regular requirement for the teaching profession. The university encourages all faculty members to attend faculty development programs organized in different domains to learn about recent developments. We find that most of our faculties attend these programs from time to time and update their knowledge. In addition to that, research is another activity through which faculty members regularly update themselves. To promote research among faculties, the university has already introduced a Research Excellence Award for faculty members and research scholars. This award provides financial and academic benefits to the faculty members. Therefore, I believe that through these measures, everyone is actively seeking the most up-to-date knowledge in their field.</p><p><strong>As a professor, can you describe your teaching philosophy and how you engage with students?</strong></p><p>Teaching philosophy is a very broad term. It includes the pedagogy you use to teach your curriculum. The ultimate task is to impart quality knowledge through your subject and help your students understand the content. To understand a particular topic, it not only depends on the pedagogy but also on the class you have and the students and their interests you are dealing with. Many times, we find that depending on the class size and the students' maturity level, we adopt different teaching philosophies. For example, in a master class, we may use digital tools like PPT, animations, and online demonstrations to make the subject more attractive. But in a large undergraduate class for beginners, where the class size is usually large, the content is delivered through traditional classroom teaching mainly through physical contact. Additionally, laboratories and project work are other learning tools through which the subject matter is made understandable to the class.</p><p><strong>What initiatives or programs has DTU recently launched to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among students?</strong></p><p>The concept of entrepreneurship and startups is gaining momentum, especially in engineering institutions. In line with that, DTU has established a Technology Business Incubation Center known as TBI under the name DTU Incubation and Innovation Foundation (DTU-IIF), a Section 8 company established in 2016. This incubation center provides mentorship and necessary infrastructure for startups and entrepreneurs to launch their businesses. Through this center, we not only provide mentorship but also offer infrastructure support to foster innovation and entrepreneurship among our students.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, what are some of the emerging fields of study DTU should consider promoting or introducing in the institution?</strong></p><p>Depending on the discipline, there is quite a good number of emerging areas of studies in engineering. There is a provision for interdisciplinary study through minors and for the implementation of minors the university has already introduced 45 different varieties of minor areas of study. For example, in computer science, you have minors in machine learning, data science or similarly you have minors on IOT’s, in electronics you have minors on VLSI design and other emerging areas of communication. All the disciplines have already introduced their minor areas of study where the students of other disciplines will opt for those mainly to widen their origin and increase their employability.</p><p><strong>Can you share with us your journey from a professor to holding one of the highest administrative position in the university?</strong></p><p>I am a professor of electrical engineering and presently looking after the task of Registrar which is a purely administrative position. I joined this University in 1999, at the time it was Delhi College of Engineering, as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. In 2007 I became a professor. It has been almost 15 years since I have been in service as a professor in this prestigious University. During the entire 24-year span of my stay I have gotten the opportunities to work at almost all the academic and administrative positions. For example, I have been head of department for more than 6 years, I was Dean Academic for almost 6-7 years, I have also worked as the controller of examination, chief warden. Whatever task the University assigned from time to time I tried to give my fullest commitment to those assignments which the University has assigned from time to time and have done all the work with my full potential and honesty. I always consider this university close to my heart, my belongingness to this university is at a very deep level. That’s the reason why during the entire 4 years of my stay I was involved in the administration deeply and due to all the trust and faith of the administration I got important opportunities and I tried to discharge my duties with my fullest commitment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does the registrar's office contribute to maintaining DTU's position as the top technological university of India?</strong></p><p>Registrar office is an office which extends services and support to all academic departments and administrative branches of university. The role of registrar is to ensure that all the policy and regulation that are framed by university authority and bodies are implemented in true sense. We always try our best to give all kinds of help and support for the overall functioning of administrative departments as well as other administrative functions of the university. We have some challenges because the university is in expanding mode. The student strength is increasing, currently we have 15000 students in the campus including our east delhi campus. So the requirements of manpower to carry out these academic activities smoothly and at ease at all levels. Where there is a requirement of faculty members or requirements of supporting staff university is putting its best effort to recruit qualified faculty members and also supporting staff but due to some administrative reasons sometimes recruitments are not done timely and because of that we are short of faculty members but any way we are managing through temporary staff.</p><p><strong>What advice do you give to the students who are planning to study at DTU?</strong></p><p>Those are planning to join this university have collected feedback about this place. So I simply convey my congratulations to them. I assure that once they join this place it is their wise decision to be here and they should also be proud of being associated with Delhi Technological University, they should be passionate about their discipline of study and must develop attitudes for academic not only attitude but also maintain academic credentials. Second thing is once you join university, university culture is different from school. In school you're in a very protective environment. Most of the time your parents are there to look after you. When you join university you have freedom, you have to take care of your academics, you have to take care of your personal belongings and your health also. So I advise everyone who is associated with this university to maintain good health by eating healthy food and following a healthy lifestyle. Every student should join a sports or other physical activities which are developed in the college like gymnasium. Apart from this one should also develop their career profile at an earlier stage of study. As engineering is a professional career and if you want to excel in a profession you should plan it and put your efforts into achievement. You have a multifaceted scope of growth impact in the engineering profession. You can go into the core technology sector, you may go into management, you may start your own business or you may join an administrative environment job as well. One should always plan at an early stage to which domain should I take over and plan your career and I think that way maintaining your good academic records and maintaining good health. You will surely get success.</p>",

It builds confidence in our personality and develops our personality wholly. Further, you learn how to tackle problems in a corporate world and gain experience for that.\"</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Placement Coordinators for the batch of 2023, Delhi Technological University, Delhi. Read on as they share their highly inspirational and impactful journey and talk about how to blend technology and leadership together to bear the best results.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You're the cohort of placement coordinators who have witnessed the shift of online to offline mode in a very pronounced manner. Has this adjustment influenced your approach to carrying out a PC's responsibilities? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each mode?</strong></p><p>It was definitely easier managing a large group of students in the online mode, since in the offline mode we sometimes had to manage 400-500 students in the campus, which was obviously quite difficult. But, as we’ve seen many people use unfair means in online assessments, so that obviously caused many problems. Moreover, another huge problem we face in online mode is technical issues. Links of meetings not working, Faulty internet connections are just a few of many problems faced by students that we must manage. Other than that, there are of course advantages; for instance, it's easier to take presentations in online mode as we can include as many as 400 students in one meet; whereas in the presentation hall, it is only possible to have about 200 students at a time. So, we’d say that online mode had a lot of hassles in terms of technical issues and regardless of the advantages of online mode, we were glad to have everyone back on campus for offline placements.</p><p><strong>Owing to the recent boom of technology and automation in every industry; placements in core branches and non-technical domains have become increasingly competitive. Do you think a technical prerequisite is necessary for the preparation of non-technical domains also?</strong></p><p>Coding is an absolute necessity for non-tech students now. We’d say that a fairly decent amount of coding knowledge is required for a good tech placement; little knowledge or the basics would not be enough. And yes, with the technology boom, the roles for core branches are decreasing as they are slowly being transferred over to AI. So, we’re getting more and more tech-related roles in this day and age. In fact, non-tech students should look out for opportunities that enable the tech team to do non-tech work as well. So, the core branch students should learn the aspects of tech that are unique to their core branch as well so they can present a uniquely identifiable skillset.</p><p><strong>How does the choice of electives affect one's placement? For example, does a minor in software engineering assist a student from a core branch to stand out from peers who do not have such a minor?</strong></p><p>We’ve been in talks with the companies and the faculties about this, and we do keep a database of the students pursuing a minor in software or COE who are in core branches. So, in future, it might help the students as they are considered fit for a tech placement by companies. That being said, one should only choose a tech-related elective if one wishes to aim for a tech placement; if not, maintaining your GPA is equally crucial and the choice of an easier elective can give your GPA the boost it needs.</p><p><strong>There is always a debate over interning in two ways: interning at a startup for more flexible learning or interning at an established organisation with predetermined corporate rules. What are your thoughts on this?</strong></p><p>In a startup, there are more opportunities to learn about every position inside the organisation and you obtain a comprehensive understanding of how a firm truly operates. Understanding corporate behaviour is also very important, as you never know where you might end up post graduation; so understanding how both of these organisations work is crucial. Given the numerous layoffs and company failures, it is safe to assume that large corporations are a safer choice to startups. Therefore, for campus placements, we advise choosing either large MNCs or startups that have already achieved unicorn status.</p><p><strong>We’ve seen entrepreneurship gaining momentum steadily; How would you say startups are supposed to recruit their workforce when entrepreneurship is on such a steep rise?</strong></p><p>Most startups in their early stages, hire students in off-campus placements. Such startups look for a very specific skill set, and as we’ve seen in our college, most candidates only have basic coding knowledge and know very little about development. So that is where the college students lack in terms of specialisation of their skills; so such startups tend to hire in off-campus placements. Whereas for entrepreneurship, DTU offers the students IIF where students are allowed to take extended breaks to develop their idea further. Given that the idea is not a fluke, and is unique in its terms. If you think your idea is unique and cannot be replicated by big MNCs easily, go for it.</p><p><strong>Many students believe that, despite having a competitive profile on par with their peers, they have difficulty being shortlisted for an interview. Is there anything specific that employers look for on our CVs?</strong></p><p>Companies tend to shortlist resumes in which they tend to look for GPA, sometimes 10th and 12th Board percentages, the projects you’ve worked on during your time at college and they also have an AI software that compares your resume to the job description offered by the company. So, students are advised to structure their CVs in such a manner that it aligns as best as it can with the company’s job description.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the mistakes that students tend to make that endanger their chances of getting placed or getting an internship?</strong></p><p>As for the mistakes that students tend to make, it is important to mention how students focus less on the core parts. For example, when people sit for tech placements or internships, they tend to ignore the core subjects like OOPs, OS and DBMS. Interviews depend 25% on these core subjects and can determine majorly whether or not you fare well in the interview. The next mistake would be how people are helplessly over-confident for the HR rounds, considering it to be a piece of cake. However, they miss out on knowing details about the company they are applying for and that might as well turn the tables for them. Ence, students must be aware about the company, their policies, work culture etc.</p><p>Further, for a non-tech company, your attitude and personality matters a lot. Therefore, those applying for non-tech roles should keep this in mind.</p><p><strong>Do previously cleared backs impact a person’s chance of getting placed?</strong></p><p>We do not share the data for any previous backlogs. Only data pertaining to the current backlogs is shared. So, there won’t arise any hindrance due to previously cleared backlogs.</p><p><strong>Do the achievements from school hold any relevance in a person’s resume for internship or placement?</strong></p><p>You are required to&nbsp; mention college achievements, of course. However, if you don’t haven't had any in college, it’s better to mention the school achievements, than leaving the section blank. The personality development on the other hand, comes in handy, whether developed in school or college.</p><p>Also, when it comes to interviews, your communication skills matter a lot. Most of the student at the university lack such skills. Hence, they lag back in the GD rounds and interviews.</p><p>Also, if you don’t happen to have any college achievements, you can mention the events you had participated in.</p><p><strong>The current economic down turn has had an impact on the company recruitments. So how are the Placement Coordinators dealing with this scenario in order to maximise the benefit for DTU Students? What would be your recommendations to students to endure this downturn.</strong></p><p>We understand that the market conditions are not good. But even this year, we have achieved placement stats are the previous years. If I were to advise students about this scenario, my sole word of advice would be that students should apply off-campus as well. Also, upon deliberations with seniors, I have brought to my attention that Q3 might be a determining point and companies might begin to recruit like before after this point. This placement season, as recession was almost on board to hit us, we asked the companies to offer more profiles for DTU Students. Like Google came for 2 profiles and Microsoft offered 3 to 4 profiles. DTU is trying its best to call new companies. Further, students must be clear which profile they want to go for in the FTE. There are enough opportunities in the university to cater to every profile and interest. One should single-mindedly move in one direction. We are trying our best to ensure all the students seeking placements get one. We still have companies coming for the previous batches.</p><p><strong>You must interact with a lot of students regarding the internship and placements. So what do you think students have the most queries about?</strong></p><p>DTU students are <i>more</i> focused when the internship or placement season starts. They are focussed on what to put on their resume.The most asked question is that if the student is in the middle of a project can he mention it in the resume. Further, students are concerned about the percentage and CGPA Criteria for the internship and placement. We are planning to hold a meet for this purpose.</p><p><strong>How damaging are the active backlogs to a student’s reputation and personality?</strong></p><p>Many companies have criteria for the internship. Some companies do allow students with active backlogs to sit for interviews.</p><p><strong>How being a placement coordinator helped you develop the personality that you possess currently?</strong></p><p>It gives us confidence to communicate with HRs and students. You have to communicate the HRs message to the students in a simple language. We do understand what topic of discussion interests both the parties. Through the pre-described process, one does develop confidence. Furthermore, being a placement coordinator, we are exposed to innumerable queries of the students and HRs and we learn about the view points and perspectives. It builds confidence in our personality and develops our personality wholly. Further, you learn how to tackle problems in a corporate world and gain experience for that.</p>",

Read on as she elucidates her inspiring rise to success and the importance of working undeterred towards one’s goal.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How has your life changed since securing AIR 19 in UPSC CSE 2022?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My life has changed a lot, majorly for good. There are new and exciting things coming. It’s a huge achievement and we don’t realise it ourselves but when we meet others especially people from rural backgrounds, they consider it a significant achievement. So, life has changed, and more people are talking about me, wanting guidance from me, and interested in knowing my strategy. The most important part is I’m looking forward to the exciting phase of upcoming training and the job part because it will be exciting to work and will be a journey full of learning.</p><p><strong>Since it was your first attempt, are you excited or nervous about how your work life would be?</strong></p><p>As you said rightly it was my first attempt but I was not nervous because the training program is the same irrespective of whether you have prior experience in some other field or not. So, in those terms, it is a level playing field and I’ll have more excitement than nervousness which will only be around 5-10 %.</p><p><strong>As a successful UPSC aspirant, what according to you is the ideal time to start preparation? Did you feel at any time in your preparation that you should have perhaps begun studying earlier?</strong></p><p>I already knew from the beginning what I wanted to do and when to start my preparation when I finish college. I took a drop year which was a very conscious decision on my part. I also had a placement opportunity but I turned it down. The reason was that my branch was ECE and my aggregate CGPA was 9.14. ECE in itself is a challenging and demanding branch. So, for the four years of college, I dedicated my time to my subjects without any compromises. The second reason would be that I was part of Enactus DTU, an active society at that time. I was also thinking, what if I don’t clear the exam even after sacrificing years of college preparing for this exam? There would be no fun part. So, I was very clear that if someone feels the need to start preparation during college in my opinion they can start in the 4th year to research about UPSC, their optional subject, and strategy but not before that because they will be having an ample amount of time and will eventually lose focus.</p><p><strong>Did you feel that your participation in society helped you while preparing for the written examination and interview?</strong></p><p>I was part of Enactus DTU which provided a lot of exposure at that time. It helped in networking across with juniors and seniors and gave exposure in terms of working on the field and interacting with people from different areas like administration and corporate. So, it was a very all-rounded exposure for a student who has just come out of school and in that way, it did help me.</p><p><strong>Which subject would you say turned out to be the decisive factor in your rise to success? How has it helped you grow as an individual?</strong></p><p>Based on my mark sheet, I have very good marks in Anthropology, even in my GS subjects and also my interview score is decent. If I have to talk about one then surely it would be my optional subject, Anthropology. It has imbibed a sense of tolerance, and understanding towards the different cultures and societies of India because you get to study a lot of tribes and cultures of different societies. So, we naturally get tolerant towards them while getting to know why a particular state &amp; their people are following a particular tradition and we try to think about it more scientifically. So, it has made me a more tolerant person.</p><p><strong>How did your college life in DTU influence your decision to give UPSC? Would you have preferred to be an Arts student, since your course would have had some topics similar to your syllabus for UPSC, or was the DTU environment comfortable for you and was the competitive nature of students even helpful in a way to aid your preparation?</strong></p><p>It might seem to some that the syllabus is arts-heavy but in my opinion the syllabus of UPSC CSE has a&nbsp; very level playing field for all the people coming from all the branches and even some people complain that engineers tend to do well in UPSC. CSAT exam has a lot of maths-oriented questions but all the allegations rather I would say assumptions do not hold much ground. As all the aspirants come from different streams be it science, arts or even commerce and have to study the same material. So, there are no biases. As an engineering student from DTU one can get a lot of advantages from the distinguished set of alumni who have cleared the UPSC CSE with such good ranks in the past. So, people took inspiration from them and it’s moving to see that people from the same environment, lived in the same conditions as you and studied the same courses are doing it. Being an aspirant you get motivated by it. It is easier to reach out to people for example there have been previous toppers who have secured rank in the top 6, top 3 and it is motivating and there are no biases towards any branch in DTU&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is one competitive exam that you and every other student in DTU or any other engineering college have in common, which is JEE. Did your JEE preparation at all resemble your preparation for UPSC? What did you find different about UPSC as compared to JEE?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>JEE and UPSC CSE are 2 different exams and the demands of these 2 exams are also very different. In JEE you just have a test of your intellect in terms of mathematical aptitude. You have your objective papers in JEE but in UPSC CSE there are 3 rounds that are objective (prelims), subjective (mains)&nbsp; and interview. So, UPSC analyzes your overall personality, not just your intellectual aptitude but also your moral and social aptitude as well. So, that's a significant difference and even preparation for these two exams is very different, the syllabus is different, that is one thing and you have to cater to the demands of these exams. In UPSC, you have to write subjective answers which is a slight difference too but one thing among both the exams is how smart and hard-working, determined and disciplined you are. These are the qualities that will definitely be going to help you in whatever state of life you are.</p><p><strong>It was a sizable risk- rejecting the safety of an on-campus placement and preparing for what is arguably the toughest exam in India. Was your family supportive of this decision and more importantly were you at peace with yourself with such a commitment? If yes, how did you manage to convince yourself to take that risk?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I took my placement offer just because my family wanted me to and my family was very supportive so I consider myself privileged in this regard not everyone is privileged to turn down the on-campus placement opportunity. My family was supportive of my decision. Also, I was able to convince them that I needed a full cycle without any distractions and I was at peace with myself because ultimately it was the decision of my choice. All over the 2 years that passed, I graduated in 2021 and the result came in 2023. So, in these 2 years, I was very content and satisfied because I was doing what I wanted to do. Since I have taken this decision, I was putting in extra hours because it was a conscious decision on my part but in the end even if my result would not come. I would have the satisfaction that the decision was mine and it was not imposed by someone else either from my family or my friends over me. So, I would suggest if you are taking any decision in life whether it is related to UPSC or related to your career. It is important to listen to people around you because you can always learn from their experience but ultimately you have to make your own choice. Once you make the choice stick to it for that duration you have thought for and even if the result doesn’t come at least you’ll have a sense of self-satisfaction of giving your 100%. As I said, even if my result would not have come positive. I would have thought of some other plan either joining the corporate or giving some other exam. So, I think that it is important you have clarity of mind and know what you are doing because if you have that you’ll easily convince others too.</p><p><strong>In our daily lives, especially in Indian culture, many family and friends raise questions regarding our decisions in life. How did you deal with those questions?</strong></p><p>Fortunately, my family and friend circle are very good. My friends were very supportive from the start, they were confident in me and gave me constant motivation. If your close family is supporting you, then you should ignore the other voices because people will always talk. So, it’s not important to listen to every voice. You don’t have to convince everyone else. But you also have to be a little ignorant in this aspect too, like how the saying goes ‘ignorance is bliss’. Sometimes people’s comments may come true after 2 years but what are you losing? But at least 20 years down the line I would not have the regret of not taking that decision. Being practical and having a backup plan is also necessary.</p><p><strong>The interview stage is one where many candidates are heartbroken after coming tantalizingly close, but just missing out on their goal. About a few months before today’s interview, you gave </strong><i><strong>the </strong></i><strong>interview of your life; tell us a bit about how you prepared for that and what the experience of giving that interview was like.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The marks distribution in UPSC is such that although the interview is a very important stage, it holds just 270 marks and a major chunk of 1750 marks is the mains marks which is the subjective test. In the interview, the questions revolve mainly around two areas, which are the current happenings and events of national and international importance and the 2nd part is your personal background. The questions generally revolve around personal areas such as your hobbies, what you studied during school and college and so on. Preparing for the interview process is mainly just knowing yourself very well. You must be adequately confident about your answers because it’s a personality test rather than an interview. They don’t judge your aptitude, they judge your overall personality. Even if you don’t know an answer, what matters is how politely you can say that you don’t know the answer and how willing you are to learn. Overall, it’s a very fun stage and you get to know yourself. Enjoy that stage if you get to reach there, it’s a big achievement.</p><p><strong>You chose not to opt for any coaching institute for your preparation; Did the lack of deadlines and the pressure of teachers bearing down on you make the process easier for you? Or would you have preferred a classroom-like environment, with fellow aspirants alongside you and the guidance of teachers to help you along?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I did not opt for classroom coaching but I did take a test series and mock interviews. If I had to go back, I wouldn’t change my decision, I’m very happy with it. I have some acquaintances and friends who opted for coaching. There’s a stage when you’re very confused about opting for coaching or not. I ultimately decided not to but some of my friends decided to. Now when I talk to them, they all regret their decision, as the coaching they opted for either did not complete the syllabus or they did not gain much from it. They ultimately had to study it by themselves. Coaching can do wonders for many people, especially for those who need some external guidance or nudging. But if you can do that exercise on your own, it’s good for you. It can go either way depending on different people, their own strengths, and their weaknesses. It worked for me, but it might not work for others.</p><p><strong>A lot of undergrads in DTU wish to go for UPSC, can you give a piece of advice to all the UPSC aspirants?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While in college do not focus completely on your UPSC preparation, also focus on your personality development because these are the four years where your personality grooms and develops. Ultimately when you reach the interview stage your overall personality will also be judged in addition to your intellect and aptitude. Divide your time adequately. Don’t lose out on your academics, they are equally important. But if you want to start the preparation for UPSC, you should enter with a clear mind as to why you want to do it. It is very important to search for the answer to that because it is a very long journey. Even if you are expecting to clear the exam in your first attempt it will take at least two years as one year goes towards the preparation and the exam cycle is itself of one year. If you do not have an answer to that why you might continuously feel demotivated. Also, be very clear about which strategy you will be adopting. You will learn many things but having a clear strategy will ensure that you do not get distracted and diverted. Keep some flexibility also. Do repeated revision and lots of practice.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>\"Being a Placement Coordinator, we are exposed to innumerable queries of the students and HRs and we learn about the viewpoints and perspectives. It builds confidence in our personality and develops our personality wholly. Further, you learn how to tackle problems in a corporate world and gain experience for that.\"</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Placement Coordinators for the Batch of 2023. Read on as they share their journey and talk about how to blend technology and leadership together to bear the best results.</strong></i></p><p><strong>As the cohort of Placement Coordinators who have witnessed the shift of online to offline mode in a very pronounced manner, has this adjustment influenced your approach to carrying out a PC's responsibilities? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each mode?</strong></p><p>It was definitely easier managing a large group of students in the online mode, since in the offline mode we sometimes had to manage 400-500 students in the campus, which was obviously quite difficult. But, as we’ve seen many people use unfair means in online assessments, so that obviously caused many problems. Moreover, another huge problem we face in online mode is technical issues. Links of meetings not working, Faulty internet connections are just a few of many problems faced by students that we must manage. Other than that, there are of course advantages; for instance, it's easier to take presentations in online mode as we can include as many as 400 students in one meet; whereas in the presentation hall, it is only possible to have about 200 students at a time. So, we’d say that online mode had a lot of hassles in terms of technical issues and regardless of the advantages of online mode, we were glad to have everyone back on campus for offline placements.</p><p><strong>Owing to the recent boom of technology and automation in every industry, placements in core branches and non-technical domains have become increasingly competitive. Do you think a technical prerequisite is necessary for the preparation of non-technical domains also?</strong></p><p>Coding is an absolute necessity for non-tech students now. We’d say that a fairly decent amount of coding knowledge is required for a good tech placement; little knowledge or the basics would not be enough. And yes, with the technology boom, the roles for core branches are decreasing as they are slowly being transferred over to AI. So, we’re getting more and more tech-related roles in this day and age. In fact, non-tech students should look out for opportunities that enable the tech team to do non-tech work as well. So, the core branch students should learn the aspects of tech that are unique to their core branch as well so they can present a uniquely identifiable skillset.</p><p><strong>How does the choice of electives affect one's placement? For example, does a minor in software engineering assist a student from a core branch to stand out from peers who do not have such a minor?</strong></p><p>We’ve been in talks with the companies and the faculties about this, and we do keep a database of the students pursuing a minor in software or COE who are in core branches. So, in future, it might help the students as they are considered fit for a tech placement by companies. That being said, one should only choose a tech-related elective if one wishes to aim for a tech placement; if not, maintaining your GPA is equally crucial and the choice of an easier elective can give your GPA the boost it needs.</p><p><strong>There is always a debate over interning in two ways: interning at a startup for more flexible learning or interning at an established organisation with predetermined corporate rules. What are your thoughts on this?</strong></p><p>In a startup, there are more opportunities to learn about every position inside the organisation and you obtain a comprehensive understanding of how a firm truly operates. Understanding corporate behaviour is also very important, as you never know where you might end up post graduation; so understanding how both of these organisations work is crucial. Given the numerous layoffs and company failures, it is safe to assume that large corporations are a safer choice to startups. Therefore, for campus placements, we advise choosing either large MNCs or startups that have already achieved unicorn status.</p><p><strong>Entrepreneurship has been gaining momentum steadily. How would you say startups are supposed to recruit their workforce when entrepreneurship is on such a steep rise?</strong></p><p>Most startups in their early stages, hire students in off-campus placements. Such startups look for a very specific skill set, and as we’ve seen in our college, most candidates only have basic coding knowledge and know very little about development. So that is where the college students lack in terms of specialisation of their skills; so such startups tend to hire in off-campus placements. Whereas for entrepreneurship, DTU offers the students IIF where students are allowed to take extended breaks to develop their idea further. Given that the idea is not a fluke, and is unique in its terms. If you think your idea is unique and cannot be replicated by big MNCs easily, go for it.</p><p><strong>Many students believe that, despite having a competitive profile on par with their peers, they have difficulty being shortlisted for an interview. Is there anything specific that employers look for on our CVs?</strong></p><p>Companies tend to shortlist resumes in which they tend to look for GPA, sometimes 10th and 12th Board percentages, the projects you’ve worked on during your time at college and they also have an AI software that compares your resume to the job description offered by the company. So, students are advised to structure their CVs in such a manner that it aligns as best as it can with the company’s job description.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the mistakes that students tend to make that endanger their chances of getting placed or getting an internship?</strong></p><p>As for the mistakes that students tend to make, it is important to mention how students focus less on the core parts. For example, when people sit for tech placements or internships, they tend to ignore the core subjects like OOPs, OS and DBMS. Interviews depend 25% on these core subjects and can determine majorly whether or not you fare well in the interview. The next mistake would be how people are helplessly over-confident for the HR rounds, considering it to be a piece of cake. However, they miss out on knowing details about the company they are applying for and that might as well turn the tables for them. Ence, students must be aware about the company, their policies, work culture etc.</p><p>Further, for a non-tech company, your attitude and personality matters a lot. Therefore, those applying for non-tech roles should keep this in mind.</p><p><strong>Do previously cleared backs impact a person’s chance of getting placed?</strong></p><p>We do not share the data for any previous backlogs. Only data pertaining to the current backlogs is shared. So, there won’t arise any hindrance due to previously cleared backlogs.</p><p><strong>Do the achievements from school hold any relevance in a person’s resume for internship or placement?</strong></p><p>You are required to&nbsp; mention college achievements, of course. However, if you don’t haven't had any in college, it’s better to mention the school achievements, than leaving the section blank. The personality development on the other hand, comes in handy, whether developed in school or college.</p><p>Also, when it comes to interviews, your communication skills matter a lot. Most of the student at the university lack such skills. Hence, they lag back in the GD rounds and interviews.</p><p>Also, if you don’t happen to have any college achievements, you can mention the events you had participated in.</p><p><strong>The current economic down turn has had an impact on the company recruitments. So how are the Placement Coordinators dealing with this scenario in order to maximise the benefit for DTU Students? What would be your recommendations to students to endure this downturn.</strong></p><p>We understand that the market conditions are not good. But even this year, we have achieved placement stats are the previous years. If I were to advise students about this scenario, my sole word of advice would be that students should apply off-campus as well. Also, upon deliberations with seniors, I have brought to my attention that Q3 might be a determining point and companies might begin to recruit like before after this point. This placement season, as recession was almost on board to hit us, we asked the companies to offer more profiles for DTU Students. Like Google came for 2 profiles and Microsoft offered 3 to 4 profiles. DTU is trying its best to call new companies. Further, students must be clear which profile they want to go for in the FTE. There are enough opportunities in the university to cater to every profile and interest. One should single-mindedly move in one direction. We are trying our best to ensure all the students seeking placements get one. We still have companies coming for the previous batches.</p><p><strong>You must interact with a lot of students regarding the internship and placements. So what do you think students have the most queries about?</strong></p><p>DTU students are <i>more</i> focused when the internship or placement season starts. They are focussed on what to put on their resume.The most asked question is that if the student is in the middle of a project can he mention it in the resume. Further, students are concerned about the percentage and CGPA Criteria for the internship and placement. We are planning to hold a meet for this purpose.</p><p><strong>How damaging are the active backlogs to a student’s reputation and personality?</strong></p><p>Many companies have criteria for the internship. Some companies do allow students with active backlogs to sit for interviews.</p><p><strong>How being a placement coordinator helped you develop the personality that you possess currently?</strong></p><p>It gives us confidence to communicate with HRs and students. You have to communicate the HRs message to the students in a simple language. We do understand what topic of discussion interests both the parties. Through the pre-described process, one does develop confidence. Furthermore, being a placement coordinator, we are exposed to innumerable queries of the students and HRs and we learn about the view points and perspectives. It builds confidence in our personality and develops our personality wholly. Further, you learn how to tackle problems in a corporate world and gain experience for that.</p>",

This transition to the chaos of the day never feels heroic, but rather a battle against societal and educational expectations. This battle continues in the oppressive summer heat that feels like a punishment, as one heads to the metro station for a 28-station journey to Samaypur Badli.&nbsp;</p><p>The metro ride, although never empty, offers a moment of respite as it signifies conquering 30% of the looming day. Amidst the constant shuffle of passengers boarding and alighting, finding a seat becomes a victory against being pushed around. The journey is shared with fellow workers, students, and travellers, creating an atmosphere of familiarity and silent camaraderie.&nbsp;</p><p>After enduring a sweltering e-rickshaw ride from the metro station to college, four hours of classes follow. Emerging into the Delhi air, brief exchanges with acquaintances occur before the routine moves to the open-air theatre (OAT) where students gather for refreshments and casual conversation. The challenge of an hour-and-a-half commute back home lingers in the back of the mind, but is momentarily forgotten in the pleasant distraction of the lush college campus.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the lure of home-cooked food and a personal bed, the charm of college life urges one to linger. As the day ends, students return to the metro, sharing stories about their day, creating a reservoir of infinite conversations. Each day, though tiring, has its unique happenings which make it interesting. Being a day scholar is challenging, but far from monotonous, painting vivid colours of adventure and growth into daily life.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration by Ayan Khajuria, 2nd Year, MCE</strong></i></p>",

This place was soulless. Everything felt extreme — trying to convey the monstrosity of university life by the colossal sheerness of the buildings, by their lifeless limbs gouged into boxes with iron-framed windows, by the circularity of every road which always looked clean-licked, recently tarred but at the same time barricaded, making a mockery of our walking feet. It felt like I was an isolated cotton plug bouncing off the surface of an uncleaned ashtray. I felt something was amiss, like an essential organ, that due to a strange subconscious law, it must have, yet it lacked at its very core.</p><p>But that’s when you hear that one soft, gentle thud. You look to your side to the person next to you who has just banged his head against the desk, partly from boredom and partly from being confined to sitting for too long for a long lecture. And somehow, it’s not an intrusion, but a welcoming distraction. The view alters when no amount of concrete could ever possibly make you not pet a cat on the staircase or stop a burst of laughter. The enormity becomes less scary when you walk these halls with interlocked arms, or a sense of achievement when you are able to reach your classroom without asking anyone. The coin starts to fade. It gives way.</p><p>Looking back I think I was the one who misinterpreted the solitude of DTU as something empty and soulless. It was never soulless. Instead, it was unique how you can easily disassociate yourself, set boundaries, give as much as you want, when you want, and take as little as you like. There is a line between being isolated and being individualistic. And it took me some time to realize that whatever was happening, all this exhaustion and fear, was encouraging me to be an individual, to stand on my own two feet. The emptiness around me became rather a place of my own, to build my own path, to gather my own thoughts, and to live on my own terms.&nbsp; And somewhere down the line, I began to like it.<br><br><strong>Illustration by Ayan Jyotir Khajuria, 2nd Year, SE</strong></p>",

C. Verma is both the bane and saviour of your existence and then in the blink of an eye, you’re eighteen, the protective cover of your JEE days long gone, opening to a realm of boundless possibilities. When I was about to get admitted into college, I had envisioned my life to become an idealistic version of its former self and formed many unrealistic expectations along the way—from myself and my college life. But it quickly turned into this:</p><p>You’re inspired and motivated for the life ahead, but wait, what did you ever do to deserve all of this, but you also deserve more, and why is the time passing by so quickly? I thought there was more to this, more to me. There used to be beauty in the mayhem of it all but now there’s just a lingering regret of your naivety, grief of what should’ve been but never was, of who you should’ve been but never were. One by one your expectations come crashing down. The test scores keep getting lower. Your peers keep moving higher. And no comments on your social life, please! You’re all grown up now but you agree with Jo from Little Women when she says \"I can't believe childhood is over\". The ghosts of your eleven, fifteen, or even seventeen-year-old self are nowhere to be found, while you try desperately to hold onto wisps of a time when ambition didn't have to be forced and hope was your next-door neighbour.</p><p>Slowly I've learned that instead of chasing the illusion of a picture-perfect college experience, there's so much beauty to be appreciated in the everyday moments, the ups and downs, and the valuable lessons learned along the way. College is not solely about attending classes and passing exams; it's a journey of personal growth and self-discovery. It’s not just about going from one deadline to another; it’s the impromptu 2 AM discussions that teach you more than your classes ever will, it’s the tacit understanding of having each other’s backs, it’s my friend sharing his tiffin with me because he knows how much I (and everyone) hate the mess food. It’s about the 100 mistakes you make but not letting them hold you back.</p><p>In Bollywood movies, we are frequently made to believe that college life is a paradise-like experience consisting of perfect friendships, stress-free exams, and fun found around every corner. While these portrayals make for entertaining cinema, they often fail to capture the real-life experiences of college students. There's heartbreak and loss, a never-ending confusion, bitterness, and jealousy that come with every lost opportunity. But there's also love and friendship to be found everywhere if you just look closely.</p><p>It's okay if you're not who you thought you'd be. Don't constrict yourself to a checkbox of personality traits. After all, there's more to life than trying to fit into a rigid mould.</p><p>Illustration Credits: Tanvi Mathur, 3rd Year, B.Des&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

All that effort did get me into the college I always wished for, but it inevitably took some irreplaceable pieces of my being from me.</p><p>I can’t tell her the truth of how big of a daedalian web human emotions can spin. I can’t tell her that the things she hopes getting into DTU will help her achieve are practically unattainable.

Well, it is rightly said that \"Too much analysis can induce paralysis\". Sometimes, being presented with too many choices may land us in such a dilemma that we end up doing nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, this ironic situation manifests even more dramatically in the lives of students with the newly adorned 'college freshers' tag. After spending a long time amidst inanimate books and rigorous coaching classes, getting bombarded with options at every step can overwhelm anyone. From day 1, freshers get confused about whether to take the easiest FEC to score in or the one chosen by most of their friends. From selecting the right clothes for Engifest to finding the most appealing item on the canteen's menu, the list goes on and on.&nbsp;</p><p>So, hardly anyone can deny that the only ubiquitous situation experienced by everyone in college is choosing one option over multiple others. Is that a problem? Maybe not! Biting more than what you can chew is an inevitable and sometimes fun part of being in college. Instead of feeling swamped by possibilities, you should go for the one that makes the most sense (without landing you in trouble, of course) and make the most out of it. After all, no matter what you choose, the mere reminiscence of those days is exactly what's going to help you sail past the more gloomy ones.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Hence, rather than worrying about the road not taken, enjoy the one you are traversing on!&nbsp;</i></p><p>Illustration Credits: Nafisa Ruheen, 3rd Year, B.Des</p>",

I was darting between my thoughts of elation, apprehension, and a persistent need to check and recheck my course schedule. Will I be able to find my classes? Will I make friends or find myself languishing in a sea of socially inept students? The possibilities were endless, and not exactly comforting. These thoughts buzzed about my head like a swarm of bees, each competing for my attention and causing me to feel simultaneously giddy and overwhelmed.</p><p>As I got dressed, the true dilemma emerged: what on earth should I wear? I rummaged through my closet, trying on different combinations of clothes as if I was writing a computer code. I finally settled on a perfect ensemble. Clutching my backpack, I decided to venture out and conquer my fears.</p><p>The moment I reached my college campus, a medley of emotions danced upon my quivering lips. Anxiety, anticipation, and a hint of bewildered excitement. My heart fluttered like a trapped bird. I trudged towards the entrance gates, each step a precipice leading me further into the abyss of academia. My nerves played a frenetic symphony within me.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a mental picture of myself wandering around campus, muttering \"left, right, no, wait, left,\" like some kind of dyslexic marching band. But as I glanced around, I saw a sea of anxious faces. I couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie. The tumultuous swirl of emotions was drowned out by the sound of hundreds of other freshers, all experiencing the same flurry of emotions.</p><p>I stood there for a moment to wonder about today. This instant, I embark upon a journey, a rite of passage, one that would either shape me into an erudite scholar or leave me lost amidst a labyrinth of textbooks and bad canteen food. What grand spectacle awaited me in this academic extravaganza?</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Saurabh Sharma, 4th Year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>Meeting new people can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. Whether you're starting college or attending a social event, initiating conversations is a crucial step towards building connections. This blog post explores two effective strategies to strike up conversations with new acquaintances.</strong></i><br><br><strong>YOU MEET SOMEONE NEW</strong></p><p><i><strong>Strategy one: Induced Conversation</strong></i></p><p>1. TAREEFAN:Initiate conversation by genuinely complimenting something you admire about the person. For example, if you notice a unique necklace, say, \"Cool sneakers man! It has such a stylish vibe, Where did you find it?\" This approach can be used for clothing, hairstyle, or any item.</p><p>2. CLASSES?:Initiate conversation by discussing shared experiences like attending an event or class. Ask for opinions or thoughts. For example, after a lecture, say, \"Insightful talk, right? Speaker was unusual though.\" Observe their reaction to engage further, as it can spark a conversation.</p><p>3. SAME PINCH: Spot someone with similar interests or hobbies, and use it as a conversation starter. For example, if you see someone reading a book by your favorite author, approach them and say, \"I love that author too! Have you read any other books by them?\"</p><p>4. GC PAR ATMA KATHA: Share an interesting or funny story related to the topic to encourage others to share their own experiences and create a connection. For example, in a group discussion about traveling, share a funny travel mishap and add some humorous stickers/memes/gifs to make it even more engaging.</p><p><i><strong>Strategy two: On Cue Conversation</strong></i></p><p>1. YOU AND ME AND STEVE: If you have a mutual friend, ask them to introduce you to the person you want to approach. This can help break the ice and make the introduction more comfortable.</p><p>2. AAS PAAS DEKHO: Comment on the surroundings or a whimsical situation nearby. Make a humorous remark to a nearby person, saying, \"Can you believe what we're seeing? Any thoughts on what's going on there?\", create a light-hearted moment together.</p><p>3. IIT BAWANA KI AMENITIES: Engage in conversation about the current environment, like a café, park, or library. Ask for recommendations or opinions about the place. For example, if you're at nescafé/hpmc/micmac/canteen, ask people nearby about their favourite items on the menu or what they think the place serves best.</p><p>4. IMPROMPTU DILLI DARSHAN OFFER: If you're in a new city or town, discuss local attractions, restaurants, or landmarks. Ask for suggestions or share your own experiences.Especially if you are from outside of Delhi and exploring this new city. Approach a classmate from Delhi and say, \"I'm new in town. Do you have any recommendations for the best places to eat around here? Any hidden gems?\"</p><p><strong>Illustration by Joshna Lohaan, 2nd Year, B.Des.</strong></p>",

On one of the most defining crossroads of your life, here you stand today; having budded from what you were, into what you desire to become. Innumerable paths and checkpoints are yet to come, better with every level. The crossroads you’re at, friends, is what they call <i>‘the golden days of college life’.</i></p><p>Sprouting out energetically from the shell of childhood, you feel liberated from all control and supervision. To a very large extent nevertheless, it is not now that you’d become the master of your destiny. There’s still a long way to go through the journey called life.</p><p>विद्यालय शिक्षा का समापन व कॉलेज जीवन में प्रवेश विधार्थी जीवन का काफी महत्तवपूर्ण परिवर्तन साबित होता है | जीवन के इस अन्तराल में विद्यार्थी अपने युवावस्था के उत्साह से परिपूर्ण है, परन्तु दूसरी ही तरफ उसका मन विचलित और असमंजस की स्थिति में है | रणभूमि में खड़े अर्जुन की भांति ही उसका मन भयभीत हैं | वह भूत-भविष्य की फ़िक्र व जीवन की अनिश्चितताओं से विचलित हैं | कॉलेज की शुरुआत में विद्यार्थी काफी सहमा हुआ होता है और अपने हर कार्य में त्रुटियों का भंडार लगाता जाता हैं | वह अभिमन्यु की भांति अपने आप को चक्रव्यूह में फंसा हुआ पाता हैं | जिसकी वजह से उसे कई बार परेशानियों का भी सामना करना पड़ता है परन्तु&nbsp;</p><p>“करत-करत अभ्यास के जड़मति होत सुजान, रसरी आवत जात ते सिल पर परत निशान”&nbsp;</p><p>कबीर जी की इन प्रस्तुत पंक्तियों को सिद्ध करते हुए और परिश्रम के साथ वह अपने पथ के प्रति और सजग होता चला जाता हैं | जिस तरह महाभारत में अर्जुन के मार्गदर्शन के लिए श्री कृष्ण उपलब्ध थे, उसी तरह कॉलेज में विद्यार्थी के पथ निर्माण में सीनियर्स, शिक्षकगण व मित्रों का खासा सहयोग रहता हैं | धीरे-धीरे समय के साथ विद्यार्थी के भीतर घबराहट कम होने लगती है और आत्मविश्वास बढ़ने लगता है जिसमें व्यक्तित्व विकास को प्रेरित करती ‘सोसाइटीस’ का भी खासा महत्त्व है |</p><p>You come to college to not only learn, but to satisfy your creative thirst. You’ve had been learning that all your school life, haven’t you? <i>Now</i> it's time to widen your horizon. The setting is brighter when you hop on the wagon called <i>college societies</i> and tread the path with like-minded people. Seniors, juniors, all alike. You’ve made it to here, it’s now time to cut yourself some slack, catch a break and enjoy with your interests and academics, all balanced out. And trust me, when you join one, you’re not gonna regret it.</p><p>The canvas of life you’re recklessly doodling on, now seeks to orient itself in a definite order; more diligently carved and precariously taken care of. As you steer clear through a period of reckless childhood to enter into a more ordered adulthood, DTU welcomes you to rejoice <i>this </i>time of your life, that they dearly refer to as the<i> ‘ordered mess’.&nbsp;</i></p><p>With things falling apart and some other falling right into place, you’ll learn how to put it all together. With pending assignments day in and day out and exams always around the corner, you’ll learn to get it done, with time. After all, you can trust when your seniors would say that you are gonna love the <i>‘ordered mess’</i> at DTU.</p><p>Illustration Credits: Akshata, 3rd year, B. Des.</p>",

I have applied for the robotics concentration so the focus will be on robotics and electronic applications. As far as applications and the prospects go, robotics is one of the most upcoming branches in engineering. After a master’s, you can either go for Ph.D. or apply for a job after a bachelor's. There are not a lot of jobs in robotics if you compare it with software development, however, after masters, there are a lot of opportunities that open up. In the future, I plan to go for a job after my master's but I have not completely decided on this.</p><p><strong>Most engineering students incline toward the software domain. What was your motivation for going on the less typical path?</strong></p><p>I was not greatly interested in computer science. I am usually inclined towards the mechanical side of robotics. So applied mechanics is the field that interested me the most but of course, in today's world, you can't ignore computer applications because robotics also needs technology. Even before entering college it was clear to me that I don't want to go into software. I am not the kind of person who could sit and work on a coding problem for too long. I was very interested in aviation and stuff so that's how I joined UAS in my first year. From there I got a keen interest in drones and gradually towards robotics in general. Mechanical engineering was my first priority at the time of counselling, which people usually don't take up nowadays. So it was mainly out of interest and I think that's how it should be. I know that the software domain has a lot of money. My friends are making a good amount whereas I will be spending more than them here but I will be doing something I like to do, something that I am actually interested in. Even if I would have gone for SDE I wouldn't have liked it much because it is not my thing and never has been.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, do Indian universities fail to provide the same kind of research facilities and career opportunities as compared to foreign universities for higher studies?</strong></p><p>Yes to a very large extent. We are behind the US at this point in time, and education in India is too focused on the theoretical aspect. All of us pursuing B.Tech here are only studying to get good marks without any understanding of the practical applications of it. I personally don't have an idea about 50% of my subjects in mechanical engineering and I think that's true for a large number of people, not just in DTU but almost in all colleges because our education system is backward. Research takes a lot of money. Our colleges are trying to promote research and specifically DTU. A lot of projects in science and technology are coming in. We're moving in the right direction but the progress is slow. I think with time Indian universities will catch up. We need to move away from this rote learning mode although there is no comparison at this moment.</p><p><strong>What were your biggest learnings in your journey so far from the mistakes you made?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The biggest learning is whatever you want to do, start early. Explore what you want to do and try to grasp one of the things you like as early as possible. The earlier you start the more time you will have to build upon. Don't be afraid to be different. Don't be afraid that there are not a lot of people who are applying for a master's. Do what you love and love what you do. I think that's the way to do it. If you don't like what you are doing you are not in the right direction.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to the students of core branches who feel there is a lack of opportunities for them because of their branch?</strong></p><p>One of the reasons why I am going for a master's is because you don't get opportunities immediately for a job in robotics. If I had the option for a job and then go for a master's degree that would have been much better. When there are fewer opportunities, there is always a way around. Going for a master's is one of them. I don't expect SDE to be such a big thing in 10 years. Things keep changing. I think if there is an overlap in the requirement and your interest, identify it and go forward.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your admission procedure. How was the support from the college professors?</strong></p><p>The application procedure starts sometime around September-October and the deadlines are from November to the end of January. All colleges have different application procedures so that's a tedious process. In the application, they mostly ask for a statement of purpose about what all you have done in that field, why you want to go for it, what all work you have done, your research work, and basically a summary of why you want to go for that course. Apart from that there are letters of recommendation from professors, which are very important. That's a very opaque process and not very transparent. One mistake that people tend to make is that they start very late. I have juniors in 3rd year asking me how to start now. If you are starting&nbsp; late you won't be able to do justice to the work that you are doing. You have to give it time, it's not immediate. That being said, if you&nbsp; work hard you can do it somehow. It always depends on the individual.</p><p>In my process, college professors were very helpful. The Faculty Advisor, Raghav Sir, ECE Department, Indu Ma’am, my B.Tech project supervisor, Mr. Atul Agarwal, Mechanical Department have been there throughout. They were very helpful and supportive. They gave me my LORs. I would say that if you continue to work under your professors for 6 months or a year or two, you build a relationship with them. If you diligently work, they identify your worth. You need to make them understand what your goals are and how they can help you. Go out as early as possible. If you ask a professor 2 months before your application for a LOR, there are very few&nbsp; chances for you to receive it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did the initial interest in aerospace develop?</strong></p><p>I was very interested in aircraft and aviation from school time. Robotics was a lot later. It's very funny to think that like a child I still look up and try to identify which aircraft it is; that child in me is still there. My interest in robotics arose in college when I joined UAS. I shifted from aircraft to robots in general so that was a transition over the two three years. I had initially planned to go into aerospace but the scope in that industry has recently become less as it is&nbsp; mainly focused on defence applications. Being an Indian I can't work in the US in defence applications. It’s very difficult to get into that segment but robotics is rightly the more generalised field so that has a broader scope.</p>",

This is what stuck and this is what I decided to pursue.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through your application process including any challenges that you may have faced and how you overcame them?</strong></p><p>It is always challenging to apply abroad. I got admission to a university in Italy but that wasn’t Plan A. Plan A was to get a direct Ph.D. from a country like the USA or Canada but I couldn’t ace that. Plan B was to go to Germany, but Germany started taking extra certificates like APS which is mandatory for the visa, and the application which takes about four to five months and you can’t apply for it unless you’ve got your degree and on those terms I didn’t have my degree yet, I just graduated. Italy was Plan C. So I applied there and I got my acceptance letter within a week of it. The biggest challenges are, I would say, the LORs. Anywhere you apply you would need a letter of recommendation from your professors and your supervisors. Writing the statement of purpose is also tedious work, you have to start writing it months before you actually apply. Then of course you have to give various exams like GRE, IELTS depending on the course you’re applying to and where.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Walk us through how your childhood interests helped you develop a liking for astrophysics.</strong></p><p>I was an average student with teachers always suggesting that I can do better at every parent-teacher meeting! But if you want me to specify, I always had an interest in math and science. Regarding astrophysics, I relished the field and everything it had to offer. So, I have a bit of a curious mind. I need to know how and why everything that happens, happens. This is something that you cannot just know. It’s based on curiosity only and space sciences offers you a lot. You cannot just go there and ask and expect to get direct answers. I think this is why I’ve been a little here and a little there because I need answers and there are none.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are some of your personal and professional goals you wish to achieve during the tenure of your Master's degree?</strong></p><p>It's just for two years so I don't think I'll get enough time to devote to other things. For now, I have planned out to have a couple of research papers and get a good research experience along with connectivity of course. People talk a lot about it in the research field only because you need connections to go further from where you are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talking about research, what specific interests do you wish to explore in astrophysics?</strong></p><p>I am particularly in astrophysics and astronomy and that too observational, modeling, and inferring information. I have worked on gamma-ray bursts. Right now I am working on X-ray binaries and fast radio bursts. These are some of the mysteries of the electromagnetic spectrum. Beyond this, I want to work on satellite galaxies. They are pretty intriguing to me, how they interact and what are the dynamics between them. So this is something that I want to explore, in my master's or if I get a chance, in my Ph.D.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Which internship would you say has been the most fruitful and fulfilling research experience for you?</strong></p><p>There are some local conferences that I did in my first year. It comprised of a theoretical portion, modeling etc. So, that was pretty satisfying. Currently, I am inclined towards simulation work; you need to visualize stuff to yield results and draw inferences. Everything is what I’ve always wanted to do. Mini projects like the one at IIT Bombay offered a pretty good exposure.</p><p><strong>Walk us through how your interest in astronomy has helped in your personality development.</strong></p><p>“<i>Asking an engineer how to develop a good personality is pretty ironic. I have a personality of a potato.</i>”</p><p>I got interviews in summer school in Nainital. There, I met 40 other people with l with same interests and goals and yet very different. This experience added way more to my personality than any other experience that I have had so far. Other international interns also belong in the same league.</p><p><strong>With your internship at APC Lab how would you say you manage time between academics and the internship?</strong></p><p>I would just say that it just takes time to become familiar with something new. After that, everything seems to fall in its right place.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to adapt to life abroad?</strong></p><p>There do exist cultural experiences,&nbsp; Language will be a barrier but, most of the people that I would be communicating with will most probably be Indians and would know English.&nbsp; Further, as I said it takes time to adapt to any change and I am pretty sure I would adapt to any such change with time.</p>",

Currently, I am inclined towards simulation work; you need to visualize stuff to yield results and draw inferences. Everything is what I’ve always wanted to do. Mini projects like the one at IIT Bombay offered a pretty good exposure.</p><p><strong>Walk us through how your interest in astronomy has helped in your personality development.</strong></p><p>“<i>Asking an engineer how to develop a good personality is pretty ironic. I have a personality of a potato.</i>”</p><p>I got interviews in summer school in Nainital. There, I met 40 other people with l with same interests and goals and yet very different. This experience added way more to my personality than any other experience that I have had so far. Other international interns also belong in the same league.</p><p><strong>With your internship at APC Lab how would you say you manage time between academics and the internship?</strong></p><p>I would just say that it just takes time to become familiar with something new. After that, everything seems to fall in its right place.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to adapt to life abroad?</strong></p><p>There do exist cultural experiences,&nbsp; Language will be a barrier but, most of the people that I would be communicating with will most probably be Indians and would know English.&nbsp; Further, as I said it takes time to adapt to any change and I am pretty sure I would adapt to any such change with time.</p>",

I was unsure and lacked a concrete plan. My initial inclination was towards pursuing an MBA, as that seemed to be the common path for engineering graduates. I hadn't considered the field of environmental sustainability as a potential career choice. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself with a surplus of time in my second semester. This gave me an opportunity to explore different subjects and gain clarity. It was during this time that I enrolled in a sustainability course offered by the University of Illinois on Coursera. The experience was transformative, and I became engrossed in the subject matter. Consequently, I found myself subscribing to numerous courses, journals, and actively seeking to expand my knowledge in this field. By a stroke of luck, everything fell into place, and I discovered my passion. It was a turning point that led me to actively pursue internships and delve deeper into the subject.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to the students of your branch who feel there is a lack of opportunities for them because of their branch? And how to choose between programs in environmental engineering which have a lot of options?</strong></p><p>Throughout the four years of my study here, I happened to encounter countless instances where I had to explain my branch choice to people. There seems to be a prevailing perception that I settled for this field because I hadn’t secured a good rank and simply wanted to secure admission at DTU. However, the truth is that this perception is largely based on people's lack of awareness about the immense potential and opportunities that my branch offers. It is disheartening to see that many individuals choose not to make an effort to understand this field. In terms of opportunities, this field is the need of the hour and experiencing rapid growth. It is essential for every sector to consider the environment and adopt sustainable practices to ensure their continued functioning. If we don't have professionals who specialize in this area, who else will drive the necessary change? It is crucial to delve into this field to realize its scope and importance. We need experts who have a background in civil or mechanical engineering but with a specific focus on environmental concerns. We are the ones who can make a significant impact. While the traditional top branches were important in the past, the current scenario demands a shift in perspective. We need to prioritize sustainability and address the pressing environmental challenges we face. The job market will respond accordingly, with an increasing number of projects inherently incorporating sustainable practices. Governments will require impact analysis, and the demand for professionals in this field will rise. There will be a boom, and we are already witnessing the emergence of dedicated sustainability divisions in prominent companies such as the Boston Consulting Group.</p><p><strong>Could you share some details about the application and interview processes for the programmes into which you were accepted? particularly Stanford</strong></p><p>The programs I applied for did not require interviews. However, I attended a session by Aviral sir, who had successfully gained admission to Stanford. One valuable lesson I learned from others is that the master's application process is highly demanding and time-consuming. It cannot be accomplished within a month; it typically requires several months of preparation. Moreover, you need to have a clear understanding of why you want to pursue a master's degree. It's a process that demands significant effort, including collecting documents such as letters of recommendation and certificates. The application process may seem straightforward in theory, taking no more than 30 minutes if you have all the necessary documents. You need to craft a well-written Statement of Purpose (SOP) that explains why you chose their program. Describe how your academic or internship journey led you there and an essay highlighting what you can bring to their diverse environment. In my SOP, I made a point to mention specific faculty members I was excited to work with. I invested time in efficient research about their work by exploring their websites and understanding their areas of expertise. Since they receive numerous applications, it's important to demonstrate that you have a genuine interest and align with their research. Your application should tell a compelling story that showcases your motivations and aspirations. In my personal statement, I emphasized the unique challenges faced by women in STEM, particularly in a lower-ranked branch. It can be tough dealing with stereotypes and jokes, even within the classroom. The perception of education in India as a means to secure marriage for women often influences how society views female students. I felt it was important to address these issues and share my experiences. Naturally, each personal statement should be different and reflect the individual's journey. Something my mother advised me was to highlight the efforts I have made to create a better space for myself to function. This aspect was crucial to me, and I included it in my application.<br><br><strong>Can you shed some light on the program's monetary vacuum, and how difficult it is to finance or self-fund an MS degree?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stanford University, unfortunately, does not offer financial aid. However, I consider myself fortunate to have a father who is a financial consultant. Through his guidance, we made the necessary investments to support my education. To gather information about funding options, I reached out to my seniors who had already gone through the process. They informed me about positions available as research assistants or teaching assistants, which provide a stipend. A portion of this stipend is allocated towards tuition, while the remainder is received as income. Broadly, different colleges and universities have their own programs for providing financial aid to students.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to leverage your MS in environmental engineering?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I anticipate completing my studies within the next 1-2 years, and I do not plan to pursue a PhD at this time. Instead, I am interested in working with a research institute or engaging in consulting work. I would like to be involved in client projects with government organizations, particularly those that align with sustainable goals and have a real-life impact. One example of such an organization is the Delhi Research Institute, which offers opportunities to work on projects that contribute to sustainability and address pressing societal issues. While I don't have a definitive plan yet, this is the general direction I am considering for my future career.</p>",

How has your work experience helped you in your master's journey?</strong></p><p>When I was preparing for my Masters, I had two things on my mind. First, I wanted to do a Masters in the field of Biology, Data Science, and related fields. So I approached Dr. Anshu Bharadwaj from CSIR Chandigarh for an internship position in her lab because the lab aligned with my interests and subjects. When I approached her I didn't get a follow back reply immediately. I mailed her in January 2021, after which she gave me a follow-up 6 months later. Soon, she gave me two projects to begin with. One of them was related to my field and the other was related to SciComm. My first project was an incomplete project from her lab which was previously assigned to a Ph.D student. I had to automate everything and I used an ML algorithm on the data. I finally completed the project in two months and I published a research paper with a good impact factor. This was the start of my foreign master's journey. I contacted more professors for a research position in their lab which aligned with the subjects for my Master's degree. I contacted Dr. Rintu Kuntum from Ashoka University. He assessed me from the interview and then we started working. We are currently doing a project that is still under preparation and will be published soon. My interest is in NLP. It is a field that is exclusively working on genomic data and I plan to work on that after my Master's. I plan to do a PhD in that field.</p><p><strong>We can observe that your acceptances entail a variety of domains, including bioinformatics, life sciences, and data science. We have two questions in my mind; Why such a variety? And second, how did you finally choose your master's field?</strong></p><p>This started in 2017 when I completed my 10th standard. I'm a lateral entry student at DTU. I have a diploma in computer engineering. After that, I had two options; to join DTU or IP University. I was getting Biotechnology at DTU, so I selected that as I had an interest in biology. I knew that I had to pursue a Master's degree, so I planned to do the same in a field combining computer engineering and biotechnology.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You've been into fields which hold very vast practical and emerging applications, what's your take on the maturity of such courses in India?</strong></p><p>Currently, these courses do not hold much value in India, and the research is still in progress. For a person who wishes to stay in India, I don't recommend this side of academics because it is still in progress and I don't know what is going to be the scenario after 3 or 5 years. That is why I decided to go to Germany since they have companies that are doing great in this field.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think research-inclined students opt for foreign universities when there is ample space for the same in India as well?</strong></p><p>The easiest answer to this would be that people don't value research here. In India’s scenario, when you pursue a Ph.D. you get a stipend of 33k-35k as a JRF or SRF, which is nothing as compared to what a B.Tech student would get after his/her degree and further go into core, non-tech, or tech field. So research is not valued in India, at least till now. It is changing, and eventually, it will change. It is also an easy option for people to get more money, thus people prefer going outside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When did you decide you wanted to pursue a Master's, and how did you shortlist the courses you'd be applying to?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It was in my second year when I joined DTU that I got to know that most of my subjects are not related to IT or CSE. I was sure that I would only do a job that would have both Biology and IT in it, so I decided to go for a Master's and not opt for a job.</p><p><strong>When did you decide in what field you wanted to pursue your Master's?</strong></p><p>I joined DTU in my second year. I found out that most of my subjects are not related to IT or computer engineering, but I was sure that I had to get a job in a field that has both IT and Biology. So, for that, I knew I had to do a Master's and not focus on the placements. So, I didn’t apply for placements at all.</p><p><strong>What will be the new career opportunities that will be available to you after your Master's?</strong></p><p>The eligibility criteria is a Bachelor’s degree in IT, Biomedical Informatics, or Life Sciences Informatics. I’ll be doing industrial research after completing my Masters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the specific domains you would explore after doing M.Sc?</strong></p><p>I’m going to do a minor in NLP ( Natural Language Processing) which includes large language models or GPT models. Research in that field is very vast by using data in the fields of biotechnology and biomedical informatics.</p><p><strong>What are the various stages of different exams and how can one clear those stages easily?</strong></p><p>First, select which country you want to go to. During the decision process of the same, I made a mistake. Initially, I wanted to go to the US. The UK has good research opportunities but it is a bit expensive. Also, the US doesn’t value international students that much. So, I didn’t apply there. I applied to the UK for the sake of it. I had two options after this; Singapore or Germany. So, I researched which was better for me and I learned that Germany values international students very much and it’s easy to earn there. So, you should prepare for GRE as it is mandatory in almost all universities but it’s not the case with IELTS or TOEFL. I appeared for TOEFL initially because it was required for the US. I appeared for GRE as it was required in Germany.</p><p><strong>What is the financial aid process for the universities you've applied for?</strong></p><p>They do not give much financial aid in the US or UK for Master’s students but they do give financial aid for Bachelor’s students as the course is not that expensive compared to M.Sc, and the same applies for Singapore. They give scholarships to students who sign a bond with them. The bond states that students have to work there for 3 years after completing their Master’s but in Germany education is free and the cost of living is not that high. As Germany is not that expensive compared to the UK, US, or Singapore, the research facilities and salaries are good, so I finally chose Germany.</p><p><strong>What is the application process for most of the universities?</strong></p><p>The application process starts one year before the year in which you’re aspiring to get admitted into any university. German universities open their applications in March. The application has several steps. The first step is acquiring the transcript from college. Then you have to write a SOP (Statement of Purpose). SOP has the most weightage in any application, so one is advised to devote a good amount of time to writing it. Some of the courses require a Personal History Statement(PHS) and then prepare for IELTS/TOEFL and your interview.</p><p><strong>What advice would you like to give the students who want to pursue their interests abroad or in India?</strong></p><p>You should be very clear about what you want to pursue to avoid rejections and you have to be aware of the eligibility criteria, and the required CGPA. A CGPA of more than 9 is sufficient. Do thorough research about the field you want to pursue. Some courses require GRE, so it's best to prepare for that as well.</p>",

So I just want to get a formal education in art.”</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>DTU Times interviewed Ms. Yati Sharma, B. Des., Class of 2023, who has been accepted for Master of Fine Arts at the Royal College of Art, London.</strong></i></p><p><strong>These four years of college sure feel like a roller coaster ride and now that you are done, you must be feeling relaxed. So before diving into the next years of your life can you please walk us through what the period at college has been like for you?</strong></p><p>So these four years were not very stable. Design as a subject I had no idea what it was going to be and about DTU itself, I had no idea before. I have explored a lot of things, have been a part of a lot of societies, have worked with teams, and research projects, attended many conferences, and made many friends and it was a very wholesome experience.</p><p><strong>The decision to do a Master's especially abroad wouldn't have been easy so now you have decided to pursue it and this time you took to convince yourself and your parents.</strong></p><p>So I am going for a Masters in fine arts with a specialization in visual communication. This is more like I want to follow my passion. It's not like I want that degree because in this field the main matter is the goal you have. So I just want to get a formal education in art. I want to switch fields from design to art so that's why I am going for a Master's. So it was very difficult to convince my parents for this because before it was very difficult to convince them for design and now telling them that I am going towards art. Basically, there was no job in art so it was very difficult but then I told them about my plans and goals and they are confident now.</p><p><strong>In contemporary times, when everybody searches for a good placement right after the degree, studying abroad can be a lonely experience. So how did you look ahead to manage the stress and overcome the dilemma of executing your decision?</strong></p><p>It was very difficult, like the entire accumulation process, and those months like from September to January was the most difficult part of my college life. Everyone else was going for placement, and I was planning to study ahead. It is a very long process even now I have applied to four universities. That was a very long process already because you devoted all your time to building a Portfolio in that direction. So it was from July onwards only that I started working towards internship and placements but I was more comfortable towards the academic side than corporate.</p><p><strong>Can you explain more about a portfolio? Is it the same as a CV or building a Portfolio is something different in design or art?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So for art and design courses, the only thing that matters is your portfolio. It portrays your art, whatever you are doing and your journey. SOPs and letters of recommendation are also important but a portfolio is the thing that supports you and what you want to do in the future. It's a compilation of all your work, your journey whatever you have done.</p><p><strong>Why did you choose the Royal College of Art, London as your institute for MFA? How does it distinguish itself from the rest of the institutions in India and abroad?</strong></p><p>It was always a&nbsp; dream to enter the Royal College of Arts, London, and the first reason to choose it is that it is situated in London and London is a very mature City, especially for arts it's a very major factor. It has all the museums and it also has a very strong alumni trait and it is the reason a lot of renowned designers and artists have studied there. I was also in touch with a few professors from there and I took mentorship from them. And as a result, I was inspired to take admission there.</p><p><strong>How did the faculty at the Department of Design, DTU help you to study and prepare for your Master's? Do you think mentorship in subjective feel like art and design is necessary?</strong></p><p>The professors helped us a lot. We have many professors from the fine arts background only. They helped me in the process because I had no idea about this field so they initially warned me about the situation of art, but then they wholeheartedly supported me. Usually, people say that faculty doesn't help you in getting jobs and placement, but in academics, if you're going to higher studies you should consult them because they have gone through all these processes and no one can help you better. A few of my professors helped me in writing my SOPs, and portfolio and also guided me for my projects. They helped me in making my portfolio and projects more academically professional than corporate-oriented.</p><p><strong>How do you feel mentorship in a subjective field like design and art helps you?</strong></p><p>Yes, it helps a lot as there is not much material available in this field. You don't study from books or online lectures for design because it's a very subjective field. So mentorship is the only thing that keeps you on track and validates what you're doing. It is rather important, especially in your academic years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would you advise to your design juniors who are passionate and want to start a career in this field?</strong></p><p>Go out and experience a lot of things. Capture whatever you experience, and not just visually. Whatever you are doing, put it in your portfolio constantly because most people decide to build a portfolio at the very end moment. Present your work in the form of a story. Do collaborations, do freelancing a lot because that's only how you can get a lot of exposure. Also, I think internships aren’t that helpful for communication especially because in India visual communication is just graphic designing so if you are into product design go for an internship but if you want to explore other fields of design like animation, collaborate with people, and professors from other universities and explore different fields.</p><p><strong>What would you like to tell readers about art and design, especially your work domain?</strong></p><p>During lockdown, I observed other creatures, like birds and animals, interact with each other. I discovered a distinct sense of smell. I saw animals interact using this sense of smell. I thought that it would be an artful idea to use the sense of smell to capture experiences. My first project was capturing the experience of rain using smells because once I was having this discussion with my mom about what the smell of rain would be, what would the experience be, and what it feels like. So everything is about that specific smell which can be used to communicate that experience but until now you don't have any medium to communicate this. For the past two years, I have been working to come up with a medium to communicate those experiences. In our last semester in design, we had to do a major project in collaboration with some industry. I collaborated with the Japanese artist Akiota who has been in olfactory art for around 20 years now. She has been working towards the same goal, to develop new modes of communication. So I collaborated with her and worked on communicating emotions through smells, how different smells can trigger nostalgia and others can trigger other experiences. In general, such communication can have multiple uses, for example in the tourist industry it can be used as a form of communication. People get to experience different emotions not just visually but also on an olfactory basis.</p><p><strong>What have been your major learnings from your time at DTU?</strong></p><p>DTU has given me a lot of freedom, especially in the department of design. They provided the tools for exploring and gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted to do. This was one of the factors that attracted me to design. Also, there was a very mixed atmosphere here, we have designers, engineers, and business students. You get a lot of exposure in college through internship opportunities and societies which helped everyone in building a network, socialize with people, and build personality.</p>",

How has your work experience helped you in your master's journey?</strong></p><p>The DRDO internship gave me an insight into how research labs work in the real world, outside of college. I worked with the Defence Lab in Jodhpur, in the domain of Desert Environment Science. I worked on the up and coming stealth technology for defence aircrafts, which gave me a lot to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Qualcomm has been one of the highlights of my career; I worked there for the past two years. It started with a two-month-long remote internship during&nbsp; the pandemic, which was a good starting point for my corporate journey. I got a PPO in the same team I interned in, which I joined right after graduation in ‘21. I worked as a Physical Design engineer at Qualcomm, which was very rewarding to me considering that the work we specialised in aligned well with the specialisation I’m aiming for in my MS. So, it has been a fairly decent experience at Qualcomm.</p><p><strong>When did you decide to pursue a master's, and how did you shortlist the courses you'd be applying to?</strong></p><p>I had made up my mind about pursuing a master's degree while I was pursuing B. Tech at DTU. My interest in electronics grew during the 4th semester when we had more electronics-oriented subjects in our curriculum. As I worked on more and more projects and subsequent internships, it became quite clear to me that I wanted to pursue my master's in the same industry. The publishing of my first research paper was the biggest motivating factor in my decision to pursue this discipline further. After one year of working at Qualcomm, I was introduced to many different teams working on the same project but with different tasks. So while I’m currently working in back-end VLSI design, I wish to get into front-end digital design and the ideal way to go about that would be through a master's program. So, that’s what motivated me to go for a master's degree.</p><p><strong>You were the editor-in-chief of DTU Times. How do you think the role helped you in your applications, and how important are college societies when it comes to master's applications?</strong></p><p>Speaking of college societies in general, working within a team helps you as an individual. You can work on your soft skills and communication skills, which can't quite be replicated in a classroom. Working in a society introduces you to a lot of people from different branches and different academic backgrounds which further enhances your outlook. So, collaborating with such a mix of individuals in a college society helps you grow, communicate and be more expressive. It’s very helpful for job interviews, adjusting within a team and working in different organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of DTU Times specifically, it was the biggest factor that helped me write all my application essays. The command&nbsp; I got over language by writing articles,&nbsp; interacting with seniors, taking interviews and working on editions was extremely helpful.</p><p><strong>How do you think an MS is different from an M.Tech?</strong></p><p>The institutions abroad generally don't have an MTech degree, so the MS degree over there is somewhat similar to the MTech degree we have in India. In both the degrees you have to choose a specialisation, since the kind of roles I wanted to take up were mostly centred in the US and the kind of research facilities I am looking for were available in the US schools, I went for an MS degree instead. In terms of curriculum, they both are essentially the same. The MTech is the Indian counterpart of the&nbsp; Masters degree in Engineering (aka MS in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It is commonly said that an MS is more inclined towards research than MTech. What are your views on that?</strong></p><p>Not really, there are multiple options in MS, there is a research track where you are supposed to publish a thesis report, there is a project track in which you have to submit a capstone project and then there is a courses track in which you just study the required courses and can go for a job after that. Even in MTech, many people convert their degree to a PhD, since they are pursuing full-time research. They also work as JRFs and RAs under different professors, so I feel that it all depends on the individual instead.</p><p><strong>Where does your major interest lie, what are your career goals?</strong></p><p>My interest mainly lies in R&amp;D, research and development, it is a mix of both academic research and a corporate job. My career goal would be to get an R&amp;D role in an organisation. My specialisation is Computer Architecture, which is something that I have been studying since my second year. I have actively been following different professors and research work for the last four years, which is why I chose this particular specialisation.</p><p><strong>Why do you think research-inclined students opt for foreign universities when there are ample opportunities in India as well?</strong></p><p>I can't comment on the general trend, but I can speak for myself, I feel like<strong> </strong>the kind of research infrastructure and facilities I was looking for aligned better with foreign universities. I had spent a decent amount of time researching the options that I had; I researched about the institutes, their research facilities, their professors, and the kind of work being done. After a thorough analysis of all the aspects of various universities, in India as well as abroad, I concluded that I wanted to pursue an MS from a foreign university.</p><p><strong>What are the major stages of the application process, and what should be kept in mind for each?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The application process is really tedious. Firstly you need to make up your mind that you want to do an MS, then you finalise your desired universities, and you should thoroughly research the program specifics, faculties and the schools which you aim to join. You must document all the required information for the list of universities you wish to apply to (It becomes really helpful at a later stage). You should keep the estimated fee structure in mind as well and check if you can afford it.</p><p>Some universities require you to appear for an English proficiency test like IELTS and a general aptitude test like GMAT. You might also need to appear for TOEFL and GRE, these exams have their specific preparation processes and you need to keep a buffer period for preparing for these exams. Once you are done with the exams, start preparing your application material, which includes a statement of purpose that highlights all your key academic and professional achievements, and why you wish to pursue that specific degree. Then you need to get letters of recommendation from your professors or employers and submit all the material before the deadline which is generally in December.</p><p><strong>What would you suggest to other students who want to pursue higher studies abroad like the US?</strong></p><p>The main question that I faced was, whether I should apply to the Computer Science (CS) Department or the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department because the courses and curriculum overlap for both of these departments in many universities and sometimes even professors teaching in both departments are the same. Students are doing their research from both the departments. So, first of all, You have to decide whether you want to apply to the ECE department or the CS department. Secondly, if you wish for a job after your master's, you need to check what the job market looks like in the country where you’re applying, specifically in your domain. You need to check for roles that are currently open. In India, there are roles that are only open for ECE graduates and some are open only for CS graduates but this is not the case everywhere. So, make sure that the job you’re looking for would be satisfied by the degree you're pursuing.&nbsp; While preparing your application materials like a CV, Letter of Recommendation, and SOP, you should highlight all those parts of your professional experiences and academics that support your application towards your domain. If someone wants to work in the field of AI then they should highlight AI projects in their application.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What specific domain do you plan to go for during your period in MS?</strong></p><p>It was very tough to decide whether I want to apply to CS or ECE and some universities have Computer Engineering which comes between CS and ECE. So, I’ll be pursuing Computer&nbsp; Architecture and VLSI which is an overlap of both the departments, CS and ECE.</p><p><strong>Are there any domains related/remotely related to Computer Architecture that you may want to explore?</strong></p><p>Yes, definitely. I will have options to explore Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Computer&nbsp; Science and Embedded Systems and Digital Design in Electrical. Apart from this, there is a newly emerging field of Human-Computer Interaction, which I would also like to explore during my master’s.</p><p><strong>What is the financial aid process for the universities you've applied for?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Financial aid is different for different countries. In the US, financial aid is different from state to state and school-to-school. Some schools provide various scholarships to students based on their previous academic records, some states give you an opportunity to pay the in-state tuition fee which is a lot cheaper than the foreign tuition fee. Sometimes, professors can make recommendations to the university to give you a tuition waiver or some sort of financial aid. There are different third-party scholarships that you can apply for, during your application or after getting admission. They have their own test and interviews before giving you the scholarships. It’s not always feasible for universities to provide all students with a scholarship. So, some students have to pay their whole fee by themselves but once you start your studies abroad there are various opportunities for you to earn money and pay for your expenses.&nbsp;</p>",

जो हम से रिश्ता तोड़ लिया, ऐसे अंधेरे कमरे में धूल खाने को छोड़ दिया ?” मुझे ऐसा लगा की मैं गूंगा हो चूका हूँ, ना मेरे पास शब्द थे और ना ही उनके सवाल का जवाब था। वहाँ से भागने के लिए मैं पीछे मुड़ा ही था की किसी ने मुझको रोक लिया और मुझसे यह कहा</p><p>“कहाँ और कब तक भागते रहोगे?</p><p>और कितनी रातें ऐसे परेशान होकर जागते रहोगे?</p><p>कभी ना कभी तो इनसे भी सामना करना ही होगा।&nbsp;</p><p>भागने की बजाय डट कर लड़ना ही होगा।&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>केवल यह नहीं बल्कि इस पर भी विचार करो की,</p><p>तुमने क्यों सब कुछ शुरू किया था ?”&nbsp;</p><p>मैं किसी से भाग नही रहा हूँ और ना ही मुझमे किसी से लड़ने की क्षमता बची है। यह भी नहीं जानता हूं की मैं क्यों रातों को जगता हूँ। मैंने ये शुरू किया था क्योंकि मुझे हर कण में एक मधुर ध्वनि सुनाई देती थी। करीबियों में सबसे ज्यादा भावनाएं मुझे समझ आती थी। मुझे कभी पैसे,यश, कीर्ति इन सब की भूख नहीं थी। मेरे लिए हमेशा से ही संगीत एक जुनून था, मुझे केवल इसी से मिलता सुकून था। परन्तु इस समाज के तिरस्कार और कड़वे-कठोर शब्दों के मार ने मुझे अंदर से तोड़ दिया था इसलिए मैंने संगीत का ही दामन छोड़ दिया था।&nbsp;</p><p>तुम यह सब क्यों मुझसे पूछने आए हो? यह पूछकर मुझे एक बार फिर सबकुछ याद दिलाने आए हो। कैसे और कितनी मेहनत,अनुशाशन से मैंने खुद को इस काबिल बनाया था। मैंने माँ-बाबा को चंद लम्हों में नहीं बल्कि महीनों में मनाया था। बचपन से मैंने बस एक सपना देखा था, उसी&nbsp; सपने को हासिल करने का अरमान लिए मुंबई आया था लेकिन मेरे सभी अरमानों को लोगों के पक्षपात ने तोड़ दिया। मुझको वह सब फिर से याद नहीं करना, मेरा हृदय पहले से ही बहुत खंडित है, उसे और नहीं तोडना है। मुझे यह बताओ इसके पीछे तुम्हारा उद्देश्य क्या है? तुम कैसे इस कमरे के अंदर आ गए ? बस मेरे इन्ही कुछ प्रश्नों के उत्तर दो।&nbsp;</p><p>कमरे के अंधेरे कोने में खड़े उस साये ने जवाब दिया - “मैं तुम्हारे बारे में सबकुछ जानता हूँ, मुझसे&nbsp; कुछ भी छिपा नहीं है। मैं हर घड़ी तुम्हारे शरीर के एक अभिन्न अंग की तरह रहा हूँ, कभी साथ तो कभी पीछे चला हूँ। तुम्हारी संगीत सीखने की वह पहली क्लास हो या बाबा ने जब तुम्हें पहली बार बांसुरी दिलाई थी,तुमने पहली धुन बनाकर माँ को ही तो सुनाई थी। ट्रेन तक माँ-बाबा दोनों छोड़ने आये थें। तुमने अपने मित्र रजत के ही हाथों किसी को खत भी भिजवाए थे | तुम्हारे हाथ से उसने किस तरह अपने हाथ छुड़ाए थे। तुमने जो बातें किसी को नहीं बताई वह सब बातें भी मैं जानता हूँ केवल बाहर ही नहीं तुम्हारे अंतर्मन तक मैं तुम्हें पहचानता हूँ। क्योंकि तुम्हारा साथ ना मैं कभी छोडूंगा और ना ही कभी यह संगीत छोड़ेगा।”</p><p>आखिर कौन हो तुम ? इतना सब कुछ कैसे जानते हो? मैंने जो अभी तक किसी को नहीं बताया वह सब कुछ भी कैसे जानते हो ? आत्मा हो या कोई तांत्रिक हो ? अब तुमसे जब कुछ छुपा नहीं है तो बताओ मुझे मैं क्या करूं जिस से सब कुछ ठीक हो जाये ? माँ-बाबा ही नहीं जो भी मुझसे दूर चले गए हैं वह भी मेरे पास वापस आ जाये ? कभी-कभी सोचता हूँ कि कहीं यह संगीत भी मेरा साथ छोड़ ना जाए। चुप मत रहो ! कुछ तो बोलो, मेरी बंद आंखें तो खोलो। मुझे अपना चेहरा तो दिखाओ, बस एक बार रौशनी मे तो आओ।&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>उस साये ने लम्बी सांस ली और कहा - “मैं अब प्रश्नों के उत्तर नहीं दूंगा क्योंकि हमारे पास कुछ क्षण का ही समय है। बस इतना कहूँगा कि चाहे कुछ भी हो जाए कभी हार मत मानना। पूरे जी जान से फिर एक नई शुरुआत करो, एक बार फिर मुझ पर और खुद पर भी थोड़ा तो विश्वास करो। बस इतना कहकर वह रौशनी में आया। उसे देखकर मैं डर से काँप गया | वह थोड़ा आगे बढ़ने लगा और मैं उलटे पांव पीछे&nbsp; चलने लगा, धीरे- धीरे हम दोनों की चाल बढ़ने लगी और फिर अचानक वह किसी भयावह आत्मा की भांति मेरे अंदर समा गया। मेरी नींद डर से टूटी और आंखें खुली की खुली रह गई क्योंकि सपने में मैंने जिसको देखा वह साया कोई और नहीं बल्कि स्वयं मैं ही था।&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Tanvi Mathur, 3rd year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

Many of us have fond memories of watching movies with family and friends, enjoying the larger-than-life characters, addictive music, and captivating stories that Bollywood movies offer. Let's take a trip down memory lane and explore the evolution of Bollywood from the 1990s to the present day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I remember the time when standing in long queues for movie tickets was the norm and the excitement for new releases was palpable. The anticipation for a movie release was at an all-time high and the hype surrounding it was infectious. The atmosphere inside the cinema was electric, with the audience cheering and clapping. These memories remain etched in my heart and continue to bring a smile to my face.</p><p>The 1990s marked a significant era in Bollywood, where the industry witnessed the emergence of various new genres. Movies like \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" and, \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" captured our hearts with their unforgettable characters and catchy songs which we still remember and adore. Although most of you probably weren't born at the time, I am sure all of us have watched many films from that era on those “box-type televisions\" with our families.</p><p>Just like many of you, the Bollywood movies from the 2000s were an integral part of my childhood. I grew up watching movies, dancing to their catchy tunes, and memorizing their dialogues. In addition to the conventional Bollywood-style light-hearted movies, I was intrigued by the new wave of experimental filmmakers. Movies like \"Rang De Basanti\" and, \"Taare Zameen Par\" which were a departure from the traditional Bollywood formula, fascinated me while growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2010s era was the time when I had matured enough to properly understand the movies. Movies like “Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani” and “Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara” awakened my inner wanderlust and imparted valuable lessons on the significance of friendships and relationships which still hold. While romantic comedies and family dramas remained a part of the scene, Bollywood in the 2010s saw a rise in content-driven films, like \"Dear Zindagi\" addressing mental health and \"Dangal\" focusing on women's empowerment. These films played a significant role in shaping the perspectives of our generation.</p><p>I have been fortunate enough to see Bollywood transition from one era to another. As I look back to those times, I feel a sense of nostalgia for the movies, the music, and the memories. Bollywood will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to cherish these memories for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Illustration Credits: Sarthak Sharma, 4th year, B.

Such a feat can only be accomplished by the masterful creation of music, which holds the power to shape cultural trends and influence pop culture at large.” Read on as Sara Sanwal, 3rd Year, B.Des. explores the enchanting world of film music and its transformative impact on storytelling and society</strong></i>.</p><p>Music has always been an important aspect of the cinematic experience.&nbsp; Throughout the evolution of cinema, music has remained a quintessential element in shaping the emotional impact of visual storytelling. From the days of silent films, where live musicians would provide accompaniment to enhance the imagery, to the contemporary era of blockbuster films featuring grandiose orchestral compositions and infectiously catchy pop singles, the power of music to captivate and move us has only grown stronger. The role of music in creating a sense of time and place, as well as eliciting emotional responses from the audience, cannot be overstated. To create memorable musical accompaniments to visual storytelling, composers and filmmakers must work together to create effective movie soundtracks. Successful movie soundtrack examples can shed light on the techniques and strategies used to capture the essence of a film. Leitmotifs, or musical themes associated with specific characters or ideas, can help to maintain continuity across a film series.</p><p>Movie soundtracks aren't just for the big screen. They have the ability to influence popular culture beyond the confines of their respective films, as evidenced by the inclusion of pop songs in movie trailers and the creation of standalone soundtrack albums.The enthralling world of film music combines sound and vision to create something magical.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start with my own two favorite music compositions for films as examples.</p><p>\"Interstellar,\" Christopher Nolan's 2014 space epic, is a masterpiece of cinema that immerses audiences in a breathtaking journey through time and space. At the heart of this incredible film is the stunning score by composer Hans Zimmer, which perfectly captures the grandeur of the story and the emotions of the characters. One of the standout tracks on the \"Interstellar\" soundtrack, \"Cornfield Chase,\" evokes a feeling of weightlessness and wonder. With a haunting piano melody that sets the tone for the track, the music becomes more intense as strings and percussion join in, building to a thrilling and awe-inspiring crescendo. Zimmer's ability to elicit strong emotions in the listener is evident in this piece, as it captures the sense of adventure and longing at the core of \"Interstellar.\" Luca Guadagnino's 2017 romantic drama \"Call Me by Your Name\" is a cinematic gem that takes viewers on an emotional journey of self-discovery and love. The stunning soundtrack, which perfectly captures the emotions of the characters and the film's setting, is at the heart of this beautiful film. Sufjan Stevens' \"Mystery of Love\" is a standout track that captures the bittersweet feeling of first love with gentle guitar strumming and soft, melancholy vocals. \"Visions of Gideon,\" another highlight, features Stevens' haunting falsetto vocals and delicate piano melodies that perfectly capture the raw emotions of heartbreak and loss. The soundtrack also includes throwback songs that transport viewers to the early 1980s and the film's Italian countryside setting. Giorgio Moroder's \"Lady Lady Lady '' and F.R. David's \"Words\" are perfect examples of this with their nostalgic synth-pop sound. Overall, the \"Call Me by Your Name\" soundtrack is a beautiful and evocative work of art that perfectly captures the film's themes and emotions.</p><p>The use of music background scores in films has had a significant impact on how audiences perceive and relate to the characters on screen. One prominent example is the use of iconic music pieces such as Ennio Morricone's iconic whistle in Kill Bill is a hauntingly beautiful melody that has become synonymous with Uma Thurman's character, The Bride. It symbolizes her unwavering strength and determination, making it one of the most recognizable pieces of music in modern cinema. It evokes a sense of empowerment and determination, reflecting the character's fierce spirit and relentless pursuit of justice.</p><p>In recent years, the use of music background scores in films has grown in popularity, particularly on social media platforms such as Instagram Reels. This trend has had a significant impact on how people perceive and present themselves online, causing the main character syndrome to resurface. Generation Z can feel empowered and in control of their lives for a few moments by playing the roles of strong and confident characters.</p><p>The enchanting marriage of music and imagery is the catalyst that infuses storytelling with renewed vitality. Such a feat can only be accomplished by the masterful creation of music, which holds the power to shape cultural trends and influence pop culture at large. Indeed, the incredible influence of music is a testament to its boundless potential.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Tanvi Mathur, 3rd year, B.Des.</strong></i></p>",

Read on as Ritwij Kashyap, 3rd Year, IT, weaves a quantitative analogy for the intangible abstracts in an attempt to emphasize the importance of self-love.</strong></i></p><p>As much as one would like to believe, there is no such thing as limitlessness. Kindness, love, gratitude, hatred, evil, and conceitedness are all intangible, making it harder to come to terms with the concept of their limits. Society preaches that one should be kind, one should be loving, and one should appreciate others - unconditionally.</p><p>At the risk of sounding nihilistic, I fear these intangibles have a quota. A quota which is replenished upon reciprocation. Hate fuels hate, kindness begets kindness, and love attracts love. If spent unconditionally, they are bound to run out. This ideology does not encourage incessantly putting out negativity in the hopes of getting rid of its quota, for one may end up with more than one started out with. After all, the cruel truth is that negativity is much more likely to be reciprocated than positivity.</p><p>Being unconditionally kind to others may put one in a position where they’re left with very little kindness for themselves. I believe unreciprocated goodness is often followed by self-loathing and self-doubt. One begins to come up with justifications for what is morally unjust by taking upon themselves all the blame. The compromises one begins to make on themselves have extremely detrimental repercussions. This unkind behaviour towards oneself can be seen as a direct consequence of running out of the kindness quota,</p><p>It may sound absurd to quantify something so abstract, but for someone who has trouble grasping abstract concepts, this arithmetic analogy serves as a helpful metric to gauge how well I’m treating myself. This is not to say that you should not be kind; on the contrary, my analogy urges everyone to be kind. Reciprocation is the key to achieving practical limitlessness; if everyone mirrors the good they receive, the quota keeps refilling, and a desirable abundance is accomplished.&nbsp;</p><p>The takeaway from all this is to be selfish at times - to know when to stop, step back, and take a prudent look at your treatment of not just others, but yourself too. If you find an imbalance, pour more wherever necessary. Rest assured, all else will be taken care of by the quota of intangibles.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration Credits: Devanshi, 3rd year, B.

    "body": "<p>“When you can identify discomforts within yourself early and act to relieve them, you can prevent them from escalating further into pain.”</p><p>As the idea of mental health has gained enough momentum to invite all eyes and ears, it has become equally imperative for everyone to deal and heal with it on personal levels. In the past, many people weren’t open to the discussion of mental health and weren’t proud of their journey with it. Even now, this topic of discussion is deemed as taboo and individuals avoid getting stuck in its discourse.&nbsp;</p><p>A more popular opinion suggests that people do regard whatever is visible, as more plausible and obvious. Hence, physical breakdowns are given appropriate attention to, however mental breakdowns run short of apparent and appropriate evidence and response.</p><p>Thus, it is high time that we talk about how to be<strong> KIND TO THE MIND.</strong></p><p>Our mind, brain more so, is essentially the one thing in the human body system that everything is pivoted around. And as it is well understood and easily come to terms with, it is as true and undebatable that catching a break is as important as it is to do work. After a long and hectic day's work, it is fairly important to take some time out and catch leisure time doing relaxing activities, some, if not all, in order to strike a balance between activities in solitude and social and productive activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, it is truly said and easily understood that most activities in solitude help your mind to ease off and settle in place after a long day's work. Reading, listening to music, and writing are some activities that help achieve the task of vegging out at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Of all, the best way to alleviate the inevitable measures of stress is to get one's head down, maybe snatch forty winks once in a while. Not only because it's scientifically proven to take the edge off the levels of stress and anxiety, but, following a regular sleep routine calms and restores the body, improves concentration, regulates mood, and sharpens judgment and decision-making.</p><p>With the world changing and new ideas being put forward, the human mind is more at work than ever. And therefore, it is high time to cut it some slack and let it get enough rest and rejuvenate.</p><p><i><strong>Illustration by Shivanshi Sharma, 1st year, B.Des (@shivanshi_sharma6)</strong></i></p>",

The uneasiness that you can't escape, entangled anxiety and paranoia, which doesn't allow you to make sense of your surroundings, emotions or feelings.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding your own emotions is a long winding, complex and unclear process. But I believe that as complicated, confusing and intriguing emotions are, there is a certain beauty attached to it. I was told to write something on beauty and that led me to think who even decides what is beautiful? It is a social construct after all and anything deemed “desirable” is correlated with beauty.&nbsp; Emotions can be beautiful too. Happiness and calmness may be beautiful but why not sadness and grief too? As disorienting as they are, they do have a strange familiarity to them. Same with fear, despair and anxiety. By no means am I asking you to romanticise sadness, but the blanket of uneasiness that you carry around with you that allows you to dwell in it, and truly appreciate happiness when it comes. A cup of hot coffee on a cold wintry day and the sublime sun rays permeating a dark room are complementary. So are feelings.</p><p>Anger is the fire that, when carefully tended, can forge the tools of change and illuminate the path to a more just and beautiful world. Sadness and grief are the rain that waters the seeds of empathy and understanding, nurturing the roots of compassion that bloom into the gardens of resilience and healing. Envy is the mirror that reflects our aspirations, reminding us of our desires and the potential for growth. It's the spark that, when tempered with self-awareness and motivation, can ignite the flames of determination, driving us to reach for our own stars. Anxiety is the wind that, when harnessed, can set sail on uncharted seas of personal growth and discovery, navigating the turbulent waters of uncertainty to find hidden treasures of strength and resilience.</p><p>Humans aren't any way designed to be happy, the matrix made sure of it. But instead of dwelling on it, realise that they are there. Feelings just <i>are</i>. Maybe appreciate them a little more?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illustration Credits: Idhika, 1st year, B.

During my third semester, I gave coding a try, but it never really appealed to me. My senior, Ritik Bhaiya was my key mentor throughout the process. With his guidance, I was able to delve very deep into the world of digital electronics. In the 2 month break after 4th semester, I opted to develop my skills instead of doing an internship. </p><p><strong>Bagging the Internship</strong></p><p>I managed to get to the interview round at Texas Instruments fairly early during the internship season.</p><p>The interview lasted for almost 2 hours. It began with basic personal questions and gradually progressed into subject-specific questions, to which I responded confidently. However, towards the end, they presented questions related to CMOS, a topic I had limited knowledge of at the time. The relentless questioning about CMOS left me in tears. It was an emotional experience for me, and by the end, I was too drained to ask questions in return. </p><p>I received a call from TI that evening where they asked a few HR questions and asked me whether I would be willing to revise the topics I struggled with during the interview and I eagerly agreed. After the call, my friends were thrilled, but I remained a little sceptical.&nbsp;</p><p>When I received confirmation of my selection the next morning, I was filled with an immense and profound sense of happiness and joy.</p><p>I do believe that luck played an important role in my selection. Our classes were mostly online, due to which I could focus on enhancing my skills.</p><p><strong>My Experience at Texas Instruments</strong></p><p>I had received my offer letter at the beginning of my third year and I joined TI as an analog EDA Intern at the end of my third year. </p><p>My team was called EDA (Electronic Design Automation). It was responsible for designing the software which would facilitate the work of all the other teams.</p><p>In the initial days, since I hadn't been allotted a cubicle, I had to share a cubicle with my buddy Pranay who had been working in TI for around 5 years. He was a great guy and I loved sharing a cubicle with him. After a while, the EDA team shifted to another building in the same Techpark where I got my own cubicle. Since this building lacked a proper canteen, we took buses to the main canteen. The entire EDA team would get tea and hang out on the roof for a while sometimes. After lunch, we would walk back from the canteen.</p><p>Half of my office floor was occupied by my EDA team, split into development and applications teams. I was part of the applications team, focusing on the backend. </p><p>Initially, for every doubt, I went to my manager. But over time I developed better relationships with my colleagues. With time, I gained an understanding of each person's role and whom to approach for specific doubts. A DTU alumnus was also a part of my team, so it helped me gel with the team easily.</p><p>I developed a strong work ethic there and became very punctual. While there were not any fixed hours of work, I worked for many hours in my initial days to prove myself.</p><p><strong>During the Internship.</strong></p><p>On my first day at Texas Instruments, there was an induction ceremony, and I was introduced to my team. </p><p>My first week was all about getting a brief on the overall flow of things and what was expected of me. I was also instructed to learn about CMOS and learn Python, Perl, and Tshell. A lot of my work had to do with data handling and pattern recognition in data.</p><p>In my second week, I was introduced to ICT files. ICT files are used for electromigration analysis for a technology stack. Understanding the data in these files is crucial to ensure the long-term reliability of electronic devices in the long-term.</p><p>My first project was to design software that could work on any ICT file of any different type. They were being made manually which took about 1-2 hours each. For each technology, more than 100 ICT files were to be made. My automated code created these 100s of files in 21 seconds. This took me around 1.5 months. My manager was also quite happy with my work in the mid-term review.</p><p>My second project was converting .dat to an ICT file. These .dat files were last modified in 2001 and had to be converted. Since the ICT file would only be generated once, I hardcoded it and finished it during the remainder of my tenure at TI.</p><p>After my internship, for my review, my manager expressed his appreciation for how well I gelled with my colleagues and how I wasn’t afraid to ask for help. I was also told that he would be putting my name for the PPO, and I was delighted when I heard that.&nbsp;</p><p>During these two months, I learned many valuable lessons. I learned the importance of diversifying one's skill set. Merely focusing on coding or DSA is not sufficient, nor is concentrating solely on hardware. Corporate life taught me the importance of adaptability and the need to embrace the tasks assigned, even if they don't align perfectly with one's initial expectations. </p><p><strong>Some Advice for Juniors:</strong></p><p>1. Avoid comparing yourself to others. Everybody’s journey and struggles are different.</p><p>2. Don’t simply follow the crowd. During the first few semesters, explore all the different opportunities and discover your own path.</p><p>3. Learn Python. It is an excellent language to learn for automation.</p><p>4. CGPA is a very important factor and matters a lot. Try to maintain a 9+ CGPA. I know it may seem very difficult, especially for core branches but not unachievable. Basically, grind hard to get the best results!</p>",

Foreign research internships generally require you to have prior research experience in the field you're applying for. I had done 3 research internships during the previous summer and winter breaks in different domains of environmental engineering. Additionally, I was engaged in a couple of research projects under the guidance of several professors. Lastly, I made it my priority to maintain a high CGPA as I believe it can prove to be a differentiating factor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Selection Process</strong></p><p>I applied for this internship through the Taiwan Experience Education Program (TEEP) website. There are projects from various disciplines of engineering listed on the website. One must apply directly to the professor in charge of the project via email. Typically, the professors review the student's CV and transcript, followed by an interview to see if they are a right fit for the program or not. Following the submission of the required documents to Professor Tseng, I was interviewed for the position. I got the invitation letter to join as a research intern in Professor Tseng’s lab at National Taiwan Ocean University a week later.</p><p><strong>The Onsite Experience</strong></p><p>Embarking on this journey initially seemed intimidating, but it was an amazing experience to visit Taiwan for my summer internship. I was fortunate to be accompanied by Omair and Yasa, my batchmates from DTU as fellow interns. Having familiar faces around made it relatively easier to settle in. Despite occasionally encountering language barriers, both the faculty and students I met were consistently eager to help. They very often went above and beyond to make sure I had everything necessary to carry out my responsibilities. The lab members always involved me in discussions and valued my input.&nbsp;</p><p>The Taiwanese people were very warm and welcoming, to the point that it seemed too good to be true sometimes. Even though Taiwan is a small country in terms of landmass, it was baffling to see how much it has to offer. Exploring Taipei, renowned as one of the cleanest and most well-planned cities globally, was a delight.&nbsp; I loved exploring the nature, lakes, beaches and waterfalls around Taiwan.</p><p><strong>The Internship: Highlights, Challenges and Everything in Between</strong></p><p>In Professor Tseng's lab, my research centred around performing a comparative study between the YSI ProDSS probe and fluorometric technique for chlorophyll measurement in seawater. I contributed to collecting seawater samples and their on-site analysis from marine shrimp aquaculture farms on Taiwan's eastern coast. I was also responsible for conducting a 3-day lab experiment for gauging the amount of chlorophyll pigment using the fluorophotometer. This study culminated in me making an in-depth report, entailing a review of literature. I also created a research poster for a competition conducted by the University wherein I secured second place.</p><p>The best part of my internship was the field trip to marine shrimp aquaculture farms. Professor Tseng rented cars and arranged our accommodations, as that the sampling locations were quite distant. Despite enduring over 12 hours of fieldwork daily in scorching heat, it proved to be a valuable learning experience. I gained insights into the intricacies of sample collection, analysis, and storage during this trip. The interactions with local farmers and hearing how our work positively impacted their lives made it a truly fulfilling experience and one of my most prized memories of the internship. I was surprised by the respect and admiration they held for us and our work.</p><p>Professor Tseng played a pivotal role during my time at National Taiwan Ocean University. She went the extra mile to make it easy for me to adjust in the beginning. She was extremely supportive and was available to always answer my queries, ensuring that I had the best learning experience during my time under her guidance. Despite her demanding schedule, she made time to monitor my progress and offer valuable suggestions.</p><p>My experience and that of my seniors who did their internships in India were poles apart. This opportunity allowed me to work on a project with a very visible and direct impact on the society and environment.</p><p><strong>My Key Takeaway</strong></p><p>This internship instilled in me the resilience to remain undeterred by challenges. I had to constantly push my limits in the face of a fast-paced research environment. The final week was super hectic, characterized by mostly sleepless nights, preparing the report and research poster. Nonetheless, this relentless effort paid off, as Professor Tseng was impressed with the quality of my report and presentation. I also secured second place and received a cash prize of 1000 Taiwan dollars in the poster competition. This experience is bound to enhance my prospects of gaining admission to a prestigious institution for higher education.</p><p><strong>Advice for Juniors</strong></p><p>1. Always be truthful in the interview and never portray yourself as someone you're not. Authenticity is key.</p><p>2.Try to gain relevant research experience by working on academic projects and doing internships. Engaging in extracurricular activities and being active in college societies can help create a well-rounded profile.</p><p>3. Work hard right from the beginning. CGPA is the key differentiating factor in bagging foreign internships. Try to keep a 9+ CGPA to enhance your chances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

I feel I am what we call a jack of all trades. I always believed in having spikes in my CV and thus had a plan set in mind to gain those spikes.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that my CV got shortlisted for almost all companies, I have maintained a 9+ CGPA over the course of 7 semesters, which became my first spike.&nbsp;</p><p>My second spike — the one I feel was most crucial, were my internships. My internships helped me work on my soft skills as well as sharpen my technical skill set. The exposure and experience I got while working on projects during my internships helped me gain familiarity with the different tools, which became the talking point during my interviews.&nbsp;</p><p>My third spike was my involvement in extracurriculars. I was an active member of two societies, focusing on finance and consulting and helping in positions at both. My role here showcased my leadership skills and how I worked within a team. To sum it up, a well-rounded profile with relevant work experience allowed me to have great interviews with the recruiter, who showed great interest in my resume.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Into the Internship</strong></p><p>I was a part of the CFR CoE at American Express, working with the New Accounts Credit Risk team. Any applicant who wishes to apply for an Amex card has to open a new account. Once the application is submitted, a series of credit and fraud risk checks are performed to assess the creditworthiness of the applicant and decide on card approval. My team essentially worked on the backend of this process and the implementation and authoring of risk rules against which an application was tested for all global markets.</p><p>There were four rounds in total, of which three were in-person rounds. The first round was CV shortlisting. Next, we had a GD in round 2. Post-round, I was unsure of my qualification chances, as I felt that I didn't grab enough opportunities to speak. However, ultimately, remaining calm during the round, maintaining a positive demeanour towards the recruiters, and putting forward my points in a crisp and concise manner helped. Following this, we had an interview in round 3, where the recruiter asked us about the things mentioned in our resume, our technical skills, knowledge of guesstimates and case studies. Finally, the last round was a short HR interview round. The overall interview experience was smooth, and I feel all candidates were interviewed in great detail.</p><p>The project I worked on had a high business impact and was all done in real time. Working on an actual project and impacting thousands of customers made it an enriching experience for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Amex experience and takeaways</strong></p><p>My experience working at American Express was truly delightful, and I’d say Amex really lived up to my expectations. All employees, including interns, were provided with perks like free food, pick-up and drop-off facilities, and the ability to work from home. As a standard, all teams would come to the office twice a week, where I’d meet my team members as well as my managers and other leaders.</p><p>The most memorable moment for me was when I was able to successfully complete my first official project deliverable after almost a month of training and shadow projects. It was a small deliverable, yet it required considerable effort, and I had to work with multiple stakeholders for it. Finishing that task and marking it as complete filled me with joy and a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>The best thing about Amex were the people I got to work with — everyone was so helpful and welcoming. Everyone supported me throughout my 8-week journey and cleared any and every doubt I had. I was entrusted with key deliverables, allowing me to gain confidence. At the end of my internship, when I was asked why I’d want to come back, the reason I gave was the kind of people I met here and the work culture.</p><p>My overall takeaway would be to not be overwhelmed when stepping out of your comfort zone. During my initial weeks, I was completely perplexed by the nature of the work I was assigned, and it was something entirely different from what I had expected it to be. Knowing that it wasn’t something I had experience in or how I would move from there to the roles I fancied, it all seemed like an impossible nut to crack. However, soon I remembered an important thing that I had learned through a TEDx talk, which said that you should always be open to grabbing new opportunities, no matter how difficult they may seem at the beginning, as you never know where they may take you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Advice for the aspirers</strong></p><p>My advice to everyone seeking placements would be to always plan for things in advance. I feel that everyone should plan for their goals and have a rough idea in mind as to what they wish to achieve and what steps are to be taken for the same in a given timeframe. Proper planning ensures that you do not waste time doing things haphazardly, which are often irrelevant to your goals. I planned my college journey right from year one; the effort I put in my first two years paid off in the final two, where I was pretty relaxed and did not have to take stress or scramble for internships and placements. So always have a plan, tick off things that get done along the way, and be laser-focused on your goals.</p>",

Build your interest: I think that a passion for technology is not &nbsp;present from the very beginning;it is nurtured as we do more and more questions every day. For me, it was the moment when those red lines started turning into green; \"Accepted\" – that was the moment when I truly began to cultivate what we call \"interest.\"</p><p>2. Daily Coding Practice: I made it a habit to engage in some form of coding daily, even if it was just an easy gig question or a mere YouTube lecture.</p><p>3. DSA: After learning the basics, I advanced to Data Structures and Algorithms, following Love Babbar's sheet, and combining it with LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks questions.</p><p>4. Projects: After this, my focus shifted to having at least two projects, the kind where I could explain every line of code even if it's not mine. It's not about creating a huge project from scratch.</p><p>5. Advice from seniors: Listening to experienced seniors should be a must in anyone's journey. I showed my seniors my resume and gathered countless feedback from each of them in an attempt to refine my resume.</p><p>6. Mock Interviews: In the final stages, I underwent 2-3 mock interviews which were taken by my friends. This helped me fine-tune my interview skills and bolstered my confidence. If you ever find yourself struggling with English, just jot down everything you have to say, repeat it once a day, and you'll make great strides in no time.</p><p>Remember whether your preparation comes to fruition or not; whether you get the internship or not, just don't give up, until it's over.</p><p><br><strong>THE APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p><p>The process for getting selected for the internship at Microsoft was an extensive journey that spanned over two months. Here's a brief:</p><p>1. Resume Shortlisting: The process initiated with the initial resume screening, where Microsoft assessed the qualifications and experiences of applicants.</p><p>2. Two Coding Rounds: Following the resume shortlisting, I faced two coding rounds. These rounds typically included questions of easy to moderate difficulty.</p><p>3. Mentorship (ML-Based Project): After progressing through the coding rounds, I was fortunate to embark on a mentorship journey. I was given 21 days for a Machine learning-based project, learning everything from scratch to present a real-time demonstration. This experience taught me how everything is possible even in a limited time frame and one has to give everything they have got.</p><p>4. Final Technical Interview: Upon successful completion of the ML-based project, my project was selected, leading to the final technical interview. This round encompassed Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), questions on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Operating Systems (OS), and Database Management Systems (DBMS). Clear and effective communication was imperative during this stage, as it makes you more credible as a candidate.</p><p>After successfully navigating these rounds, the heartwarming moment arrived when I received a congratulations email, marking the end of the 2-month selection process.</p><p><br><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p>Before the interview, there was a mix of excitement and apprehension. I knew that I had put in the effort to prepare for the process. While I had confidence in my preparation, the unknown factor of how the interviews would unfold naturally brought a touch of nervousness.</p><p>However, the moment I found myself in the virtual meeting room with the interviewer, a certain warmth was established. I got to know that the interviewers are not intimidating figures, but rather are very kind and simple.</p><p>One valuable perspective that I strongly believe is the realization that the company has intentions to hire me. So, it wasn't an obligation on their part, that they are offering me a job; rather, it's them who are looking for real and rare skills and talents. This mindset shift, understanding that you have something valuable to offer, is something I believe you should inculcate to boost your confidence.</p><p>So, during the interview rounds, I encountered a balanced mix of questions. These included one easy and one medium-level LeetCode question, testing my problem-solving and coding abilities. Furthermore, the deep dive into my projects allowed them to evaluate how well I could think when I was trying to solve something impromptu on the spot. Additionally, questions from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Database Management Systems (DBMS) were asked to test my knowledge in these essential tech subjects.</p><p>It's perfectly normal to feel a bit nervous before the interview. However, once you're face-to-face with the interviewers, let go of fear and embrace the perspective that it's you who is offering your skills and talents. If you've prepared diligently, those initial nerves will vanish in mere moments. In fact, you'll find yourself eagerly awaiting more questions, wanting to showcase how well you've prepared, and eager for the opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities.</p><p><strong>MY INTERNSHIP JOURNEY</strong></p><p>My journey at Microsoft was an experience, marked by invaluable learning, incredible mentors, and a lot of support from my manager. From the very beginning, I was surrounded by helpful individuals who made me feel at home there.</p><p>On the first day, I was filled with excitement but was extremely nervous. I was introduced to my team, and as I looked around, I realized that we were part of one of the thousands of teams working together to make an impact.</p><p>The first day at Microsoft left me in awe of the beautiful campus and the high scale of its operations. The sights of golf carts to travel between buildings, nap rooms, phone rooms, and the striking interior design were just the beginning of what Microsoft had to offer.</p><p>One remarkable aspect of the Microsoft Office place where I worked was the freedom and flexibility it offered. You could stay back at the office if needed, and there were nap rooms available. So, when I was working on my final presentation, I stayed back at the office without any restrictions. The office space felt like a safe and comfortable home, and you had the complete freedom to choose where to work, what to do, and how long to stay.</p><p>Moreover, the Microsoft Office was a sight to behold at night. The office had a beautiful ambience, and the views from the top floor were picturesque, which made me feel extremely peaceful and relaxed.</p><p>In the initial weeks, I admit, I had some doubts. I was anxious and not entirely sure if I could meet the requirements. To address this uncertainty, I committed myself to rigorous study, dedicating nearly 10 hours a day to understanding the project's nuances. I began my work days early, arriving at the office at 8 AM and often returning home well past 10 or 11 PM.</p><p>While it might seem like a gruelling schedule, I did not take it as a con, instead, I revelled in the fact that I had gotten an opportunity to work hard and to be a part of a team making a real difference.</p><p>So, in the 4th week, the project gradually began to take shape and make progress. The journey was a transformation, and my last day was filled with numerous learnings, emotional moments, and cherished memories. It was a chapter I will never be able to forget throughout my life.</p><p><strong>MY ROLE, RESPONSIBILITIES AND GETTING TO WORK WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY</strong></p><p>As an intern at Microsoft, I had the opportunity to work on an intriguing project within the expansive realm of Microsoft's Hyderabad location. In my case, I was assigned to collaborate with the SAP developers within the team called \"Commerce Plus Ecosystem, Commercial Financial Services, Cloud + AI,\"</p><p>My role primarily revolved around utilizing Python and Azure cloud services to streamline and optimize the daily operations of SAP developers. This involved a significant learning curve, as I was relatively new to the domain of cloud computing. To bridge this knowledge gap, I delved into the numerous documentation and resources provided by Microsoft,</p><p>To give a gist, my responsibilities were to develop automation solutions that would enhance the efficiency of SAP developers. This entailed automating the process of generating ABAP code, segmenting it into logical sections, deciphering its pseudocode, and documenting it at the push of a trigger. Furthermore, I worked on automating the process of updating the documentation whenever changes occurred in the original code, integrating it with Azure DevOps for production.</p><p>Initially, the project posed significant challenges, and I was met with moments of doubt. However, the key to surmounting such difficulties lies in studying as much as you can.</p><p><br><strong>WORK CULTURE AT MICROSOFT</strong></p><p>The work culture at Microsoft, during my internship, was quite flexible. You could choose when and how long you worked. Full-time employees usually worked from 10 to 5, but interns like me often worked late. There was no pressure from managers or mentors; they encouraged us to take breaks, make friends, and go home early. We had a manageable workload, and we could ask for more work if we wanted. Overall, it was a balanced and supportive environment.</p><p>I also made great connections with fellow interns from colleges across India. We all got along well and had a cheerful experience working together.</p><p><strong>SETBACKS, CHALLENGES AND PUSHING FORWARD</strong></p><p>My intern experience was quite different from what my seniors had described. In the second week of my internship, I contracted dengue fever, which was a major setback. I was in a new city where I didn't know anyone, and falling ill at such a crucial time was challenging. I had to be admitted to the hospital, and I remained sick for a complete two weeks. I eventually flew back home and started working from home. After recovering, I went back to Hyderabad to continue my internship.</p><p>This experience taught me some valuable lessons. It reinforced the importance of not giving up, even in the face of adversity. It showed me the significance of persisting through difficult times. When you're determined to make things right, even in challenging situations, you can overcome them. I managed to complete the day-one requirements of my project on time, and I received immense support from my team during this challenging phase. I even had the best presentation on the floor.</p><p>My internship was a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and I faced some tough times, but I didn't lose hope. In the end, things turned out well, and I learned that perseverance and determination can help you overcome even the most challenging obstacles.</p><p><strong>ADVICE FOR JUNIORS</strong></p><p>\"We have to make a determination and take action. Unless we do so, our environment will not change in the least, though 5 or 10 years may pass, \"that time\" will never arrive.<br>\"That time\" is the moment you resolve from the depths of your heart,<br>\"Now I will stand up and fight!\"<br>From that instant, your destiny changes. Your life develops. History begins.\"</p><p>This quote has been a steadfast beacon of inspiration in my life and it resounds in my mind, especially during moments of doubt and despair. It's the reminder that \"that time\" is not a distant event but a moment of inner resolve, a commitment etched in the very depths of the heart, to boldly declare, \"Now, I will stand up and give everything I have got!\".</p><p>For those who are now reading my story, my fundamental philosophy regarding the commencement of preparation is simple: take that first step, no matter how small. Just start, perhaps with one question a day, or one documentation task daily. Then, gradually amplify your efforts, pushing yourself to tackle two, three, or more questions each day. It's the act of taking that initial action that sets the wheels of progress.</p>",

Build your interest: I think that a passion for technology is not &nbsp;present from the very beginning;it is nurtured as we do more and more questions every day. For me, it was the moment when those red lines started turning into green; \"Accepted\" – that was the moment when I truly began to cultivate what we call \"interest.\"</p><p>2. Daily Coding Practice: I made it a habit to engage in some form of coding daily, even if it was just an easy gig question or a mere YouTube lecture.</p><p>3. DSA: After learning the basics, I advanced to Data Structures and Algorithms, following Love Babbar's sheet, and combining it with LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks questions.</p><p>4. Projects: After this, my focus shifted to having at least two projects, the kind where I could explain every line of code even if it's not mine. It's not about creating a huge project from scratch.</p><p>5. Advice from seniors: Listening to experienced seniors should be a must in anyone's journey. I showed my seniors my resume and gathered countless feedback from each of them in an attempt to refine my resume.</p><p>6. Mock Interviews: In the final stages, I underwent 2-3 mock interviews which were taken by my friends. This helped me fine-tune my interview skills and bolstered my confidence. If you ever find yourself struggling with English, just jot down everything you have to say, repeat it once a day, and you'll make great strides in no time.</p><p>Remember whether your preparation comes to fruition or not; whether you get the internship or not, just don't give up, until it's over.</p><p><br><strong>THE APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p><p>The process for getting selected for the internship at Microsoft was an extensive journey that spanned over two months. Here's a brief:</p><p>1. Resume Shortlisting: The process initiated with the initial resume screening, where Microsoft assessed the qualifications and experiences of applicants.</p><p>2. Two Coding Rounds: Following the resume shortlisting, I faced two coding rounds. These rounds typically included questions of easy to moderate difficulty.</p><p>3. Mentorship (ML-Based Project): After progressing through the coding rounds, I was fortunate to embark on a mentorship journey. I was given 21 days for a Machine learning-based project, learning everything from scratch to present a real-time demonstration. This experience taught me how everything is possible even in a limited time frame and one has to give everything they have got.</p><p>4. Final Technical Interview: Upon successful completion of the ML-based project, my project was selected, leading to the final technical interview. This round encompassed Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), questions on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Operating Systems (OS), and Database Management Systems (DBMS). Clear and effective communication was imperative during this stage, as it makes you more credible as a candidate.</p><p>After successfully navigating these rounds, the heartwarming moment arrived when I received a congratulations email, marking the end of the 2-month selection process.</p><p><br><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p>Before the interview, there was a mix of excitement and apprehension.

For Core, I just went through YouTube videos, lectures and guides.The selection process started off with an online assessment. So in the online assessment there were a few questions based exactly on the core topics such as OS, DBMS etc. So working on that is really important. Also solving problems on LeetCode is very important as well.</p><p><strong>INTERNSHIP SELECTION PROCESS</strong></p><p>To get an internship at Walmart, you have to go through three rounds where they select 150 people. The rounds were mainly focused around the online assessments. While Walmart doesn't directly recruit on campus, they have partnerships with about 15 schools across India. Students from those schools can participate in the online assessment. The three rounds include a multiple choice question round and two coding challenges. Once you complete those rounds, you'll get the internship. From DTU, about 30 students were chosen.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you start the internship, it's a two and a half month program located in Bangalore at Walmart Global Tech. Then if you want a full-time job, you'll have internal interviews. They don't actually do interviews at the beginning of the internship to give you the role. Instead, interviews are conducted at the end of the internship period. During that time, they'll assign you some problems to work on as well as development work. The interviews will also include data structure and algorithms questions.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, there was only one round of interviews, but the number can vary depending on your manager's review.</p><p><strong>THOUGHTS AFTER GETTING SELECTED:</strong></p><p>When I got the internship, I was relaxed. I wasn't doing any DSA after that. I did do more CP after some time because in my mind I was too focused on getting a full-time offer. The internship was just for two months, it wasn't a long term goal. I got the internship in September. For two months I had nothing to do, so I was just relaxing, because I had done a lot of work before getting the internship.&nbsp;</p><p>The season we're in now is very uncertain. People aren't getting many job opportunities. It was quite clear from the start that big companies and many companies weren't hiring people. There was a bit of fear I think among all of us. I would wake up at around 9 and go to the office till 5, then come back to my PG and study DSA for 2-3 hours. After that I would rest again and study more DSA. So those 2-3 months were a real struggle. But it worked out pretty well for me in the end.</p><p><strong>MY FIRST DAY AT WALMART</strong></p><p>So my first day as an intern was really memorable. As I mentioned, my manager had never had an intern before. He was used to only having full-time employees working with him. So on the first day, all the other managers were calling their interns to check in, and get to know them. I was sitting in the room hoping I'd get a call soon. They said calls would start around 3, but it was 3:45 and I hadn't heard anything.&nbsp;</p><p>I was officially assigned a team lead, but two days went by and I still hadn't connected with them. Finally on the third day, my manager realized what was happening around. He said \"Oh, I was looking for you but I didn't have your contact info.\"&nbsp; We both had a good laugh about it later, and it made for an interesting start to my internship for sure!</p><p><strong>GETTING SETTLED IN</strong></p><p>At Walmart I was there with a team which was very experienced. My manager had been with the company for a long time, since they first started in India. He had a team of 40 people who were all very experienced, in their 40s and 50s.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, it was an adjustment for me since it was my first corporate job experience. I wasn't very sure if I could just talk to people or ask questions. But everyone was very friendly. They treated me like family even though I was much younger. I ended up becoming the&nbsp; only intern who was given a very good farewell party.</p><p>It also took some getting used to living in a hotel by myself and in no time I began feeling homesick.&nbsp;</p><p>Work became my escape. I'd look forward to going into the office each day from 9 to 5. Once everyone left at the end of the day, it was tough. I'd just be waiting around, not wanting to go back to the hotel.</p><p>The Walmart office holds special memories for me in this regard. It was a refuge when I needed to get away from the loneliness of the hotel. I really cherished the time there with my colleagues each day. It provided me great comfort during a difficult time away from home. Work became more than just a job - it was a place I could go to feel less isolated and be more around people who respected and supported me. The Walmart office will always remind me of that period. It became a home away from home.&nbsp;</p><p>The team really came through with helping me adjust and made me feel more included. They gave me a lot of opportunities as well. One time, a head from the American setup of Walmart visited. I was the only intern who got to present my ideas to her and discuss them. She was very interested in what I had to say, and even invited me out for lunch to talk more about them.

For Core, I just went through YouTube videos, lectures and guides.The selection process started off with an online assessment. So in the online assessment there were a few questions based exactly on the core topics such as OS, DBMS etc. So working on that is really important. Also solving problems on LeetCode is very important as well.</p><p><strong>INTERNSHIP SELECTION PROCESS</strong></p><p>To get an internship at Walmart, you have to go through three rounds where they select 150 people. The rounds were mainly focused around the online assessments. While Walmart doesn't directly recruit on campus, they have partnerships with about 15 schools across India. Students from those schools can participate in the online assessment. The three rounds include a multiple choice question round and two coding challenges. Once you complete those rounds, you'll get the internship. From DTU, about 30 students were chosen.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you start the internship, it's a two and a half month program located in Bangalore at Walmart Global Tech. Then if you want a full-time job, you'll have internal interviews. They don't actually do interviews at the beginning of the internship to give you the role. Instead, interviews are conducted at the end of the internship period. During that time, they'll assign you some problems to work on as well as development work. The interviews will also include data structure and algorithms questions.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, there was only one round of interviews, but the number can vary depending on your manager's review.</p><p><strong>THOUGHTS AFTER GETTING SELECTED:</strong></p><p>When I got the internship, I was relaxed. I wasn't doing any DSA after that. I did do more CP after some time because in my mind I was too focused on getting a full-time offer. The internship was just for two months, it wasn't a long term goal. I got the internship in September. For two months I had nothing to do, so I was just relaxing, because I had done a lot of work before getting the internship.&nbsp;</p><p>The season we're in now is very uncertain. People aren't getting many job opportunities. It was quite clear from the start that big companies and many companies weren't hiring people. There was a bit of fear I think among all of us. I would wake up at around 9 and go to the office till 5, then come back to my PG and study DSA for 2-3 hours. After that I would rest again and study more DSA. So those 2-3 months were a real struggle. But it worked out pretty well for me in the end.</p><p><strong>MY FIRST DAY AT WALMART</strong></p><p>So my first day as an intern was really memorable. As I mentioned, my manager had never had an intern before. He was used to only having full-time employees working with him. So on the first day, all the other managers were calling their interns to check in, and get to know them. I was sitting in the room hoping I'd get a call soon. They said calls would start around 3, but it was 3:45 and I hadn't heard anything.&nbsp;</p><p>I was officially assigned a team lead, but two days went by and I still hadn't connected with them. Finally on the third day, my manager realized what was happening around. He said \"Oh, I was looking for you but I didn't have your contact info.\"&nbsp; We both had a good laugh about it later, and it made for an interesting start to my internship for sure!</p><p><strong>GETTING SETTLED IN</strong></p><p>At Walmart I was there with a team which was very experienced. My manager had been with the company for a long time, since they first started in India. He had a team of 40 people who were all very experienced, in their 40s and 50s.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, it was an adjustment for me since it was my first corporate job experience. I wasn't very sure if I could just talk to people or ask questions. But everyone was very friendly. They treated me like family even though I was much younger. I ended up becoming the&nbsp; only intern who was given a very good farewell party.</p><p>It also took some getting used to living in a hotel by myself and in no time I began feeling homesick.&nbsp;</p><p>Work became my escape. I'd look forward to going into the office each day from 9 to 5. Once everyone left at the end of the day, it was tough. I'd just be waiting around, not wanting to go back to the hotel.</p><p>The Walmart office holds special memories for me in this regard. It was a refuge when I needed to get away from the loneliness of the hotel. I really cherished the time there with my colleagues each day. It provided me great comfort during a difficult time away from home. Work became more than just a job - it was a place I could go to feel less isolated and be more around people who respected and supported me. The Walmart office will always remind me of that period. It became a home away from home.&nbsp;</p><p>The team really came through with helping me adjust and made me feel more included. They gave me a lot of opportunities as well. One time, a head from the American setup of Walmart visited. I was the only intern who got to present my ideas to her and discuss them. She was very interested in what I had to say, and even invited me out for lunch to talk more about them. I felt like my ideas were given importance.</p><p><strong>INNOVATION, RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEW IDEAS</strong></p><p>So in my role at Walmart Global Tech, I was responsible for the Global Tech Platform, or GTP.

    "body": "<p><strong>Being appointed as the Vice Chancellor of our university, what have been the subtle changes in your life post this achievement?</strong></p><p>Being the vice chancellor of such a prestigious institution is a huge responsibility. At first, I felt unsure about whether I would be able to do justice to this demanding role despite my prior experiences in administration. However, because this is my university and I know the grassroot problems, I could understand and deal with the challenges of this position and adjust well with the support of my peers and fellow professors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have had an incredible career advancement — from Head of Department, ECE, to Dean of Student Welfare, and now the Vice Chancellor. What are your expectations from this role?</strong></p><p>Many people believe in the saying— “Aim for the moon, and you'll land amongst the stars”. Personally, however, I am not like that. I believe in setting realistic, achievable goals for myself and giving my hundred per cent for them. I don't believe in planning or thinking much about the future. Instead, I believe things keep falling into place as you work upon them in the present. As an example, I never thought I would reach this position when I joined as a lecturer here initially. Therefore, I'm really content with where I am in life right now.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;What are your primary goals and priorities now that you are in office?</strong></p><p>The priority for us is kick-starting the Career Advancement Incentives to the faculty members, which were up to date and regular at the time of Prof. Yogesh Singh. Such programmes, however, remained pending and unattended in the previous two years. By resuming these once again, I hope the faculty members are satisfied with getting what is due to them, and things keep progressing smoothly in the future.</p><p>Improving the university infrastructure is also a priority for me. Through my previous experience as Dean of Student Welfare, I am aware of the problems faced by the students and the staff members, especially in the hostels. With this office, I hope to address and resolve these concerns for the benefit of all.</p><p><strong>You have been very popular amongst the students as the Dean of Student Welfare. What have been your key learnings from this post?</strong></p><p>Bringing a smile to the faces of those I talk to feels like one of my biggest achievements for the day. I hope to continue working here with the same enthusiasm and optimism despite the formal restrictions of my office.</p><p><strong>As the first female vice-chancellor of the university, you bring a fresh perspective to its administration. What steps would you take to empower the female students?</strong></p><p>I feel that community engagement is paramount to students' development, and plans are already in motion to allot female students common rooms in departments to foster such engagement, which I had earlier found lacking. Further, crèche facilities for female staff members, initiated under Prof. Yogesh Singh are being improved and reimplemented for their betterment. Such plans were heavily impacted during the COVID-19 years due to lack of access and funding. I hope to launch more such projects in the future as well.</p><p><strong>In elementary education, female educators dominate, but this trend diminishes as one progresses towards higher education, particularly in STEM institutions. How do you wish to address this?</strong></p><p>The number of women in STEM schools is considerably less than that of men, which translates to a lack of representation in leadership and teaching roles in these environments. Perhaps reservations up to 10% can be increased for women staff members to level the playing field. Bias against women remains in STEM fields, which is not beneficial for the development of society in general. Outreach activities can also be conducted at school level to encourage girls to become engineers and scientists.</p><p><strong>Do you have any role models in your life?</strong></p><p>Two people have had a great impact on my life, the first being my doctorate guide, Prof. Shantanu Chaudhary. He is a very humble and down-to-earth person. A perfectionist, he not only pushed us to achieve our best but also inspired us to motivate our students to reach their full potential as well.</p><p>Prof. Yogesh Singh is a great source of inspiration for me. During his time in office, he worked tirelessly for the advancement and upliftment of our university, and it is only now that we are enjoying the fruits of his labour.</p><p><strong>How do you plan on encouraging entrepreneurship amongst the students in the university?</strong></p><p>The Incubation Centre has been launched previously with such an intention in mind and receives funding to support the students with grants. Further, facilities are also in place for students to take a break from their degree to pursue and develop such projects and then continue their studies again. Such measures, with regular and enthusiastic implementation, can greatly foster entrepreneurial spirit in the university.</p>",

I think that is an advantage we should capitalise on.” \r\n\r\nIn his interview with DTU Times, Nirmal Yadav, founder of Ezinore, a venture focusing on sustainable energy, talks about using data from sunlight, weather, and user habits to make solar power more efficient.",
    "slug": "edition-61-interview-nirmal-yadav-494",
    "body": "<p><strong>Walk us through the whole concept and development of your start-up.</strong></p><p>The name of our company is Ezinore Pvt. Ltd. We are involved in the sustainable energy generation sector and develop storage management systems. We take data from different factors like solar radiance, weather conditions, and usage patterns to analyse and predict user consumption patterns to maximise the efficiency produced by the solar panels and the energy stored at any particular time in the system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is your start-up restricted to solar energy?</strong></p><p>Currently, yes, but we plan to extend it to wind energy as well.</p><p><strong>What motivated you to enter this field?</strong></p><p>I always had this determination to start my venture. I joined Enactus, which deals with sustainability and renewable energy. After that, I joined Eythor Pvt. Ltd., a solar panel-oriented start-up. There, I explored and identified the gaps between renewable energy integration into the normal grid system at residential as well as commercial levels. That’s how I came up with this idea. I am still exploring more about the problems that a user faces at the residential or commercial level in terms of energy management, energy generation, and energy storage.</p><p><strong>You use AI in your venture to increase the efficiency of it all. What is its role in it?</strong></p><p>We are using AI to analyse the data we obtain from previous usage patterns, including solar irradiance and weather conditions in that area. After analysing the data, the AI will predict the user pattern such as at what particular time the user will be consuming how much power, and how much is the requirement, and based on all these data points, it will manage the energy distribution to fulfil that load.</p><p><strong>How do you receive your data?</strong></p><p>We are partnering with the Ministry of Power and getting data from smart meters at residential and commercial levels. At the end of the AI procedure, we will be able to implement our systems in any household. It will take around eight weeks to analyse the data and train our AI algorithm according to that household or commercial unit. Thus, we will have our AI working in the implementation process as well.</p><p><strong>Would you call it an AI-based venture? Or do you also provide the materials like solar panels?</strong></p><p>AI is used only in terms of the product development aspect. However, after that is completed, we will focus more on energy storage and generation systems. So, we will be providing renewable energy generation-related equipment and infrastructure. We will be open to its implementation as well. If the user has it implemented already, we will help them integrate tech connectivity with it.</p><p><strong>There is already a huge non-renewable energy market. How do you think you will compete?</strong></p><p>The word ‘non-renewable’ is very self-explanatory. You cannot replace it. At this time, it is almost crucial and imminent that you convert your lifestyle from conventional to renewable energy generation sources. Alternatives have been discovered and made commercial. It is only a matter of implementation. We have progressed a lot. We need to gear up the practical usage of this. Solar energy can be exploited exceedingly well in India. We live in the subtropical zone - the solar radiance here is much higher than in many countries. I think that is an advantage we should capitalise on.</p><p><strong>What do you have to say about the growing competition in the renewable energy generation market? How can you make yourself stand out?</strong></p><p>Most of those companies are investing in building giant power plants. They are supplying energy directly to the DISCOMs. The main problem we are catering to is that the rate of production of solar energy is Rs. 2 per unit, but the user gets it at around Rs. 6.5 per unit. This difference creates a gap between energy production and user consumption, thus affecting prices. We are a more accessible, more on-the-ground type of venture. As for cost-friendly, what is there for us to compete against?</p><p><strong>How did you manage your academics alongside managing a start-up?</strong></p><p>I think the university provides an atmosphere as well as a very comfortable academic calendar, which makes it easy to manage both.</p><p><strong>Is your family supportive of your start-up?</strong></p><p>Initially, my family wasn’t very supportive, but I explained everything and gave them time to understand my idea, and expressed how valuable their support would be to me. My family has no relation to business or being risk-takers. So I had to dismantle their ‘playing-safe’ mentality and get them on a ‘gambler’s path’.</p><p><strong>How did you formulate your idea into a venture? How did you prepare a workforce?</strong></p><p>I had the idea in my mind for a long time; I just never had the time to think more about it. But in university, I got the time. My first step was research - I studied the generation, consumption, implementation, and capitalisation of these energy sources, the investors, and the top companies in this domain. After that, I got the USIP internship where we did some work in preparing a pitch and presenting it in competitions. We won some cash prizes. Then, Rohit came along, our head designer, who took care of all the design aspects. Now, we’re a funded venture, which allows us to maintain a team of twelve. There are divisions in our company as well: the design division, headed by Rohit, the hardware division, led by Ishan, and the app development division, headed by Gopal.</p><p><strong>Where do you see your start-up ten years from now?</strong></p><p>I want to expand my venture in the Middle East and other ASEAN countries. I believe we will do well, fingers crossed. As for my team, we are constantly expanding it. The intricacies of running a start-up are becoming complex, which requires more people. But as I always say, making a team is always easier than retaining a team. I want this to become an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) Company.</p><p><strong>Any advice you'd like to give to students who wish to become an entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>Explore - get all the knowledge on your field of interest. Follow that with dedication. Immerse yourself. Completely and wholeheartedly.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>After completing your bachelor's from DTU in Mechanical Engineering, you pursued an M.A. in Public Management from JNU. What made you take this step in building your career in the long run?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I appeared for civil services straight after my B. Tech. and during my two-year training at LBSNAA, I completed my M.A. which is a course requirement at LBSNAA. It’s a valuable asset considering that is what we do here in services. It teaches us how to manage human resources even when we are faced with a lack of manpower and a shortage of resources. I’ve used such qualities from the very first day of my posting, so I’m sure that an M.A. in public management has helped me more than my B. Tech. from DTU.</p><p><strong>People who clear the UPSC examination are a cut above the rest of the student demographic in India. When and why did you wish to go towards the prospects of being an IAS officer, and how did you prepare for it?</strong></p><p>I come from a business background; my father is a businessman and my family has always been a huge factor in my push towards a stellar education. I’d heard about IAS officers in school and college from friends and family alike, and during my B. Tech., I realised I did not want to go for a career as an engineer. The only idea that remained in my head was UPSC. Business was always a fallback option, but I did not want to pursue business either. I wanted to make a greater impact, and civil services would’ve provided me with that system. As I started preparing, I realised that there was a large portion of our history and culture that got neglected. The study of general knowledge truly widened my horizons about all sorts of information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was the role of your family while you were preparing for UPSC?</strong></p><p>My family’s support was very important. They never restricted me in any way, rather they motivated me to achieve the end goal. Whenever I was unhappy with my preparation, they moved around with me and tried to look for a solution along with me. For me, personally having the luxury of a family business to fall back on was also a huge relief.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us more about life in Jharkhand and how you rose from the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate to the District Collector.</strong></p><p>Jharkhand is a place that offers me immense opportunities, it is an aspirational area. There are primarily tribal-dominated areas, under-developed areas and even a few naxal-hit areas. These sorts of places are ones where civil services can make a difference. My first posting was in Dhanbad, as SDM. In Dhanbad, I was fascinated by Wasseypur at the time. The role of the SDM is mainly regulatory, and during my time there, it allowed me to understand the nature of the work I’d be doing and it helped me grasp the basics of the work. Later on, I was posted in the city of Simdega. A place with a mere 6 lakh people population to its name at the time, Simdega was an entirely different world from the bustling city life I had grown up in and become accustomed to. It was a tribal-dominated area, with many first-generational learners. There was no electricity in the area, most villagers did not own a cellphone and there were also no internet provisions in the place at the time. It was there I learnt about the importance of civil servants in such a place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did it feel to be lauded and recognised by the country when you received the Bhoomi Samman Award?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I’m honoured to receive such a prestigious award, it's very encouraging. We worked on the digitisation of land records so that they can be easily accessible to all. Land is a complicated subject for the public; knowing which land is restricted, which land is government land, which land is private- all these queries can now be answered on a digital platform which is accessible to the general public.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What motivates you to keep excelling in your job?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My basic motivation is serving the public. The nature of the job is also something that excites me, every day is a new challenge. One gets to hold various posts and thus learn different things owing to the nature of the work the respective post demands. And of course, the encouragement from your seniors, the people working in your department, and ceremonies where all your good work is lauded is also a source of motivation.</p><p><strong>A lot of students are astray when it comes to preparing for the civil services. What piece of advice would you give to the same, and enlighten us on the tips and tricks?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>UPSC as we know is arguably one of the toughest exams in India. Sincerity and hard work are invaluable qualities in one’s preparation. It is very important to understand the complete syllabus and decide what one needs to study. Reading newspapers and garnering more and more information about anything and everything is crucial.</p><p><strong>Are there any similarities between preparing for UPSC and preparing for JEE?</strong></p><p>One basic difference is that JEE is an analytical-type exam, with mathematics and logical reasoning-type questions. UPSC involves a basic understanding of any particular issue. The subjects are entirely different of course. One has Arts-oriented subjects and one has scientific and mathematically oriented subjects. The similarity lies in the hard work and sincerity aspect of preparation. The biggest difference, I’d say, is that you can expect a certain set of questions in JEE, there is an element of predictability in the manner of questions. But in UPSC, every question, every year is different. The syllabus is expanding every year, it is a very dynamic exam compared to the static JEE exam.</p><p><strong>How can a civilian help in the development of the nation without joining the services?</strong></p><p>I think the scope of citizens has expanded. We too take help from many organisations in our work, including NGOs, and civil society organisations. Even private organisations have been actively participating through CSR. Each and every citizen is a contributor. Earlier, the services had been regulatory, but now we have evolved into a facilitator. As a facilitator, you have to bring together various organisations and provide leadership so that we can all collectively work together for the betterment of the nation.</p>",

I have struggled against the dark waters for so long, screamed myself hoarse, all in the hopes that someone above the surface would hear me. Maybe they won’t. No - maybe I don’t need them to.”</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Read on as Charvi Solanki, 3rd Year, MCE and Navya Singh, 2nd Year, EE paints a vivid picture of drowning in a sea of choices and coping with academic struggles.</strong></i><br><br>I have forgotten when exactly I waded into the waters that have now become my prison. The depths are dark, they’re cruel - they taunt my rigid, flailing body with reminders of my past failures and questions about my future.</p><p>Somewhere in a childhood haze, my mother once scolded me for being afraid of the vast ocean waves. She spoke of how one day, I'd be like a wave in the currents of my dreams and aspirations, how like the ocean I’d be vast and uncontainable. Younger days, naïve days. How do I explain to my mother that instead of thriving in the vivid world she broke her back trying to create for me, her daughter is buried by all the versions of herself she could’ve been? How am I supposed to tell her how mortifying it is to be the one drowning in the sea of know-it-all’s and competitive coaching addicts?</p><p>I came to college with a suitcase full of dreams, expectations, hopes. I came to college with bright eyes, and the light was dead before I could set the suitcase down.</p><p>For all their premeditated actions, at least most of the people in DTU <i>knew</i> what their calling was. I watch through the ripples, looking from beneath the surface of water, as seniors trickle out of TnP, wearing their starched blue shirts, smiling at each other nervously. There were exceptions - confident grins - ones who had no doubt done well in their interviews. I often imagine what it would be like if I could just manage to break the surface and join my friends in their quest to conquer the mountain that I could not see. Would I know what I'm meant to do? Would I be staring blankly at a screen with words and punctuation marks scattered haphazardly throughout the script that had no meaning? Or would I start my own business, hire the very people I felt intimidated by?</p><p>Every day is a mix of the whirlwind same old following conundrum. The prestigious FAANG jobs pay well but do I want to be a corporate slave? I could go into research but I don’t have the patience nor the acumen for it. The arts seem promising but society won't promise me a future.&nbsp;</p><p>I could dwell in the imaginary world above the surface I crafted in those haunting daydreams, erecting a utopia on expectations. My hands skim the surface, and I feel the cool air skip over my knuckles, before the water quells my efforts again. Perhaps I don't wish to spend my entire life chasing after some elusive revelation. Maybe I don’t want to anchor my entire existence in the realm of 'what if's' and a world that exists only in the mind.</p><p>Emotions churn within me like a tempest, oscillating between excitement and trepidation . Will I find my true calling, or will I be condemned to a life of unfulfilled potential? Will they hear my screams through the surface? The pressure is suffocating, the waters around me grow darker, threatening to engulf me in a wave of indecision. I kick and thrash against the stifling grip of the water as my arm breaks the surface again. I cry out in joy; perhaps I could try for government services! The precious moment of clarity is pierced as I go under again and the water tightens its vise-like grip.</p><p>I look up at the night sky through the crack in the surface of the murky waters I've forced myself into, silently praying to the stars for answers. It almost feels like my uncertainty’s shed blood, my hands grisly with the apathy of my actions, or&nbsp; the lack thereof. There’s a tombstone for all of my forsaken hopes.</p><p>I calm my body and tread the smothering waters gently. I have struggled against the dark waters for so long, screamed myself hoarse, all in the hopes that someone above the surface would hear me. Maybe they won’t. No - <i>maybe I don’t need them to.</i></p><p>I stop fighting the waters, stop fighting myself as the water rears back in surprise. The pressure eases, and I tread faster. I know I can work hard, I know I am not exceptionally gifted but if worked on long enough, I can learn whatever I set my mind to. The water retreats faster now, I can almost feel the current <i>pushing</i> me along. Perhaps, it’s not as if I <i>can’t </i>do what my friends are doing, but simply don’t <i>want</i> to. My dreams are my own and my ambitions will not be caged by those who are governed by their arrogance in thinking that <i>their </i>dreams are the only ‘right’ ones. There is a sense of solace in the realization. A gentle breeze caresses my wet brow dripping stinging salt water into my eyes, as I break the surface and finally, breathe.</p><p>Illustration Credits: Navya Singh,2nd Year, EE&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>They say that being a student means bearing the torch for the future. Yet, imagine holding that torch in your PG in Shahbad Dairy, only to have the light abruptly extinguished, leaving you stumbling in the dark with your roommates. Imagine leaving your hometown, a place so vastly different from the bustling streets of Delhi, all in pursuit of giving your all to this city, to make your parents proud. You're already grappling with the challenge of adapting, and then suddenly, you find yourself evicted—evicted by the force of nature itself.</p><p>This story encapsulates the journey of one exceptionally brave girl.Hailing from Almora, she is passionately pursuing BTech at DTU, navigating the vast cityscape entirely on her own. Throughout this journey, one steadfast companion has never left her side: her camera. Photography is not just a hobby for her, but a cherished gift from her parents back when she was in the 10th grade. They scrimped and saved for an entire year to bestow this precious tool upon her.</p><p>In the recent Delhi flood, she found herself forcibly evicted from her ground floor room. Her belongings floated alongside those of her roommates, a somber testament to the rising water. The creeping water forced initial attempts at evacuation. The relentless rain showed no signs of stopping. Gradually, there was no sanctuary left. She was on the streets.</p><p>In that dire moment, clutching her camera tightly, a stark realization dawned upon her. She had contemplated this scenario in the past, but now it all fell into a relentless sequence.&nbsp;</p><p>The memories of pollution-choked skies, suffocating smog, and merciless heat waves resurfaced with a vengeance. Her heart ached for her homeland, where the air was still crisp and the rivers flowed clear. She longed for herself to experience the purity of nature that had nurtured her into you she was. She could no longer be a passive observer to the degradation unfolding around her. In the midst of the chaos, she grappled with questions that gnawed at her soul. Was there meaning to her endeavors? Was she destined to be a mere spectator, swept away by the tide of inexorable change? In that pivotal moment, standing amidst the deluge, her resolve solidified. With her camera as her weapon, she vowed to capture the stark realities of climate change in Delhi.Her images testified to the city's resilience. Each photograph demanded acknowledgment, action. In the face of adversity, she chose not to drown away, but to rise up, to bear witness, and to be the unwavering voice that cried out for a better, more sustainable future.</p>",

    "body": "<p><i><strong>“Do we really have to climb a cliff and jump from it, to say, we went through it? Why is it that there is a social dictation that tells us what our experiences should be?”&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>The first few days of February when it was always almost too cold but not quite, and I was trying to adjust to this jarring and hustling life of being a university student, I would often find solace in reading, picking up a novel in the morning and finishing it by the time I reach home any day and every day, I always used to expect that one day, a dark cloak would fall over me and before I knew it, I would be thrown into a gloomy room and made a member of a secret society. Maybe that was too much of every single fantasy film and book that you should not read after you leave a certain age group, but I did, and still do, because somehow, neither I nor the things that I love, seem to evolve. (Except for my dog - he died, and that too was not an evolutionary process).</p><p>But that is only as long as you can block the outside world and try to ignore or gloss over real, moving things. I got so caught up in the fear of not stepping in, of not crossing lines that I surrounded myself with exceedingly and very consciously, that somehow, the only thing that I never stepped into was figuring out what life path I am going to choose. University is not only a place where you get a degree, but also a place where you experiment, try new things, make some progress, fail, realize what it is to have things rectified, and repeat. And you need to go through this, the brunt of it all, to experience life at University at its best and worst, at the height of its vibrancy, and through all its monotones. But why?</p><p>Do we really have to climb a cliff and jump from it, to say, we went through it? Why is it that there is a social dictation that tells us what our experiences should be? What if I did not want to poke my nose out of the novels that I loved and read during those winters? Why is it that having an active grasp of existential realism is the only acceptable way of progression? If some of us do think that poetry, essays, novels, and essentially words are where we belong, where our true passion resides, then why shouldn't we grasp it, take risks - risks that are worth taking, because, just so you are aware, people have found ways to capitalize their hobby of reading, that Oscar Wilde once called a staple for the ‘relaxation of the intellectually unemployed’. Not anymore!</p><p>Nowadays, you can pursue reading as a career by starting a blog of your own, where you can post reviews of the books you’ve read, while also discussing the characters, themes, and critical perceptions associated with it. You can also try to start a podcast, where you can invite authors or people from the publishing industry and discuss with them the various stages of publishing as well as the process of writing. And hey, there are organizations that pay you for sending reviews of books you read, as freelancers. So the next time you spend your entire night reading rather than sleeping and following a socially dictated routine, just remind yourself: it’s work!<br><br>Illustration credits: Mohammad Anas, 1st year, B.

I whispered to myself, “If only my problems were as easy as theirs.” The sky mirrored the deep blue colour of my shirt, and my mood echoed the same hue.</p><p>A few minutes back, I received a job offer that I could’ve only imagined getting when I first entered college. As I pondered over how this job offer might provide some much-needed relief to the strained financial situation at home, my inner voice whispered, \"And what about the startup you've poured your heart and soul into for the past two years?\", and a wave of uncertainty washed over me.</p><p>The startup was more than just a venture. It was the product of sleepless nights, countless brainstorming sessions, and the unwavering belief that I could make a difference in the world through my vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the setback of not securing the expected funding and my co-founder’s resignation earlier this year, I remained resolute in my pursuit of building my startup. While placements were initially intended as a fallback plan, I had never envisioned the possibility of resorting to them. As I sank further into contemplation, I looked at the setting sun, and a sudden clarity washed over me.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Titanic Point</i>, once a symbol of my dilemmas, now held a different meaning. As my startup’s ship sank, I found myself plunged into the icy ocean of uncertainty. The job offer exuded a sense of stability, much like the floating piece of wood to help me stay afloat and survive the chilly night. With a faint sigh, I decided to accept the job offer, all the while vowing to \"never let go\" of my startup and hoping to rebuild it someday.</p><p>Illustration credits: Anshita Tiwari, 1st year, B.

Home was but a fleeting caravan, furcated by the lines of well-mannered yet agonizing upbringing, and more so because he couldn’t decide which one to call home, his mom’s bungalow or his dad’s.</p><p>There was more to the life of a bureaucrat’s son than most of the masses would comprehend, with family time as a stubborn member of the bucket list and courtesy prevailing over freedom in every act of life. He was a sharp kid in school, thanks to the genes he had inherited, as noted by his ‘friends’. His father had gifted him a <i>bandhgala</i>, explicitly representing the obvious, on his 18th, which he had ironically considered the most well-thought gift of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>bandhgala </i>disseminated more than what could be expected. He donned the purpose-built piece of his wardrobe to places where he was expected to meet such people as his parents. “He is an officer already,” the woman clad in a silk saree uttered nonchalantly. The aura of the profession had crept adagio into his veins. Despite having gone for a degree in technical education, he bustled throughout the day to draw time for both the things at hand and fared pretty well to not let his technical education taint the coruscating kaleidoscope of history, polity and economics.&nbsp;</p><p>Being pretty much at par with foreign relations and friendships, he does subsume those in college within the broad horizon of support he has gotten so far from all spheres of life, right from dreaming of it in the <i>bandhgala</i>, and through the entire period of preparation before his attempt of the coveted exam. True to what they say, time in college lets one herald a rousing change in the course of their life.</p><p>“Are you comfortable with the <i>bandhgala’s </i>buttoned-up collar?” Mother asked.</p><p>“Pretty much,” he indisputably agreed, for the <i>bandhgala</i>, however buttoned-up, had already let the tiny ray of hope out to light the way for him through the tunnel to the end, letting him free into the correct comprehension of his goals and dreams.</p><p>Illustration credits: Devanshi Kataria, 3rd year, B.

What is the process of inviting celebrities, and how does the Cultural Council plan to raise the bar this year?</strong></p><p>The process of inviting celebrities typically involves reaching out to their management teams, negotiating terms, and ensuring logistical arrangements. We curate a list based on youth hype and budget, categorise for day or pronite, and the council then narrows it down through a ruthless vote. Our artist team, armed with tenacity, hits them up through managers, personal connections or through various artist management companies. This year, we plan to raise the bar by incorporating diverse performances, engaging the audience in unique ways, and introducing surprises that resonate with the current cultural trends.</p><p><strong>What do you think is the main ingredient to make a fest successful?</strong></p><p>Building a fest from scratch is incredibly exciting, as it involves crafting a unique experience and bringing ideas to life. Understanding the pulse of the audience, offering diverse and appealing events, and fostering a sense of inclusivity contribute significantly to the success of any cultural festival. From captivating creatives around the college to a stellar artist lineup, proper security, and efficient management – all efforts are geared towards crafting an unforgettable experience for the attendees.</p><p><strong>After three years since the onset of COVID-19, 2023 marked the return to organising fully offline events. How does it feel to be back and actively engaged in planning and executing offline events?</strong></p><p>There's an appreciation and a sense of nostalgia for the classic elements of event organising that we might have put on hold for a while during the pandemic. The return is exhilarating. It feels like a reconnection with the essence of cultural celebrations. Being actively engaged in planning and executing offline events brings a sense of vibrancy and shared joy that virtual events couldn't fully capture.</p><p><strong>How does it feel to be doing the 50th edition of Engifest, India's Biggest College Cultural Festival?</strong></p><p>It's a momentous occasion to be a part of the 50th edition of Engifest. The milestone signifies not just a celebration of the festival but also a testament to the enduring cultural spirit at DTU. It's a celebration of the festival's enduring legacy and the collective efforts of the Cultural Council and DTU community. The anticipation surrounding this milestone edition adds extra significance to the event, making it a cherished moment in Engifest's history.</p>",

The examination has a broader purpose of preparing individuals for life, offering enduring knowledge and skills.”</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>In a recent interview with DTU Times at Yuvaan, Mr. Abhishek Mishra shared his insights on engineers in civil services, managing college curriculum and UPSC preparation.</strong></i></p><p><strong>What are the benefits and drawbacks that engineers might encounter during UPSC preparation and in civil services?</strong></p><p>I believe there are many advantages to being an engineer and attempting to pursue civil services. The major aspect of this exam, as per recent trends, indicates that a greater number of engineers qualify. What aids engineers in this exam is their background in a professional degree, where they become accustomed to long hours of work. Due to the discipline and logical ability developed during engineering, they perform well compared to students from other streams.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There are numerous college students who are preparing for UPSC along with their academic commitments. What would be your advice to such students?</strong></p><p>In the context of engineering colleges, there is considerable pressure on students' time to complete the college curriculum. I suggest optimising time and focusing on basics such as reading NCERT books to build a strong foundation. Consistency and dedicating around 2 hours daily for preparation, is stressed. Online courses are recommended for flexibility, allowing students to self-pace their preparation while eliminating the challenges of travelling long distances for offline coaching.</p><p><strong>How can a college student assess if a career in Civil Services aligns with their interests or aspirations?</strong></p><p>I recommend reviewing the experiences of other students from an engineering background. The decision also hinges on an individual’s preferences and personality. Apart from that, I would like to mention that both extroverted and introverted individuals can find Civil Services suitable, as personality transformations are observed during the preparation and service period. The examination has a broader purpose of preparing individuals for life, offering enduring knowledge and skills.</p><p><strong>We see a lot of students who try to clear the Civil Services Examination for years, but the result does not turn out to be in their favor. What would be your advice to such aspirants?</strong></p><p>Accepting that life extends beyond UPSC is important. Even if success in the exam isn't attained, the understanding gained about the nation's geography and economics and the mere fact that one understands the true sense of every column of the newspaper, is something to be considered a significant personal achievement. One should see success beyond entering civil services, and in becoming a good citizen of the nation. There are many examples of individuals excelling in other fields after not being able to clear the exam. I would advise students to take the journey as steps in life, giving one's best without fixating on success or failure.</p>",

What I try to do is that I try to make things as simple as possible.</p><p><strong>With the growing popularity of AI, what is your opinion on the oversaturation of jobs?</strong></p><p>Every invention is initially met with scrutiny.

She looked around one last time, hidden behind the trees near Raj Soin hall, for anyone who might recognise her. It was probably an impolite joke, enticing her to believe in ‘magic’ just to catch her wearing this horror. She sighed as she put them on; prank or no, she couldn't afford to miss out on the possibility that this thing might actually work.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked around with her hideous new eyes at… nothing. Where there had been the Academic block a few seconds ago, was just empty land, littered with trees and wild vegetation. That answered the question about the potential prank situation, she supposed.&nbsp;</p><p>She headed towards the Electrical Department, passing by OAT on her way. She ogled open-mouthed at 5 year olds sitting in huddles, discussing tech internships and placements. These glasses worked too well for her comfort.</p><p>Upon reaching the familiar confines of her department, she looked through the windows to yet again see toddlers sitting in the class. She blinked in surprise as she recognised her favourite professor. The face he must've once worn in his prime lacked the frown lines, and he looked considerably less follically challenged and was missing his characteristic stern set moustache. The classroom itself looked unblemished, missing the indentations and marks left by students long gone. For that matter, the very <i>air</i> around her felt cleaner, the colours around her popped brighter in the absence of the dreary grey fog that choked her city’s lungs everyday.</p><p>Monkeys swung from the branches of trees that should have been the pillars of Pragya Bhawan. People drove by in cars she could only remember seeing in the grainy pictures that emanated joy in a way she and those around her no longer remembered. She breathed in the silence, the beauty in the absence of things. She could get used to this version of DTU. Maybe she could wear these glasses to college every day, it would certainly lift her spirits to see kindergarteners arguing about recession.&nbsp;</p><p>With a smile, she recognised her friend waving her short arms at her, her tiny toddler frame struggling as she ran up to her. She was about to tell her about what she’d found when the 6 year old said to her with a completely straight face, “Those are the ugliest eff-ing glasses I have ever seen.”</p><p><strong>Illustration credits: Bhavika Rathore, 1st year, B.

    "body": "<p>In a rare occurrence, I crossed paths with two students from my alma mater today. It felt as though I had been sucked into the lesser read pages of history. I saw those two standing and giggling with their younger sibling, and it seemed like they had come to drop her off at her tuition class. As for me, I had come to drop off my son. I can’t quite recall how I found myself in a conversation with them, but I vividly remember them saying out loud, the college where they were studying at. Looking at them both at that moment, I thought I found my tribe.&nbsp;</p><p>Our conversation felt like an emotional pendulum swinging between excitement and uncertainty. I was delighted to hear about the exciting new changes they told me about, but a profound sense of desolation had crept beneath the surface of that amusement. It felt as if the very soul of our era was slipping away into the vast expanse of time.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn’t help but notice the palpable differences in their college experience compared to mine. The campus, once a familiar landscape of aged buildings now boasts sleek, modern structures. The bus-sized canteen near the science block has transformed into a proper outlet, and there are several small eateries on campus now instead of just one. <i>Maggi Baba</i> is replaced by the infamous <i>Mic Mac</i>. However, I was a bit dejected to learn that they hadn’t heard about <i>Maggi Baba</i>. They revealed a curriculum that has evolved significantly. The essence of exam season has shifted from the sight of stacked papers and books to dimly lit screens, and students now navigate through PDF files instead of flipping through the pages of their books. I sensed a hint of nostalgia for the times when the air was not intertwined with the constant hum of laptops.</p><p>But nonetheless, the camaraderie among the students remains timeless. I laughed to myself when they mentioned the late-night study sessions, tea breaks in the canteen, cursing the exam date sheet, and bunking classes because sleep is more important, at the end of the day.</p><p>Our conversation unveiled a shared anxiety for unfulfilled dreams and a thrill for the vast expanse of possibilities. Though I may be a mere spectator of the superficial changes now, it brings me respite in the fact that the fundamental essence of our era is unaltered.&nbsp;</p><p>Until next time.</p><p>Illustration Credits: Mohammad Anas, 1st year, B.

All of these half done conversations lie beneath the layers of scribbles, dust and indents covering the walls of every building. Painted a dim color, under a shady light, these are for the students to annoyingly bustle through, pouring their hearts out to their friends or just laughing along and this never changes.&nbsp;</p><p><i>“Oh god I just hope I pass this one time and I swear over everyone I know that I will start studying right from the beginning next semester”</i> (knowing that this next semester that’s talked about every exam season never comes). This sentence echoing from years ago is replicated even now, making it hard for the wall to believe it’s been twenty five years since it was first uttered, only to be repeated every six months without fail, by students who just started their degrees and those graduating soon alike.&nbsp;</p><p><i>“Want to go watch a movie this friday?” “I just finished watching that season last night?” </i>That’s how fast the night changed as the corridor saw a boy trying to convince his friend to grab a late night show, enticing him with a reason to sneak out of the hostel to now watching them discuss how they watched the latest trend, which will die down in just a span of forty eight hours, from the comfort of their rooms without having to even sit together.</p><p><i>“Does this course even have an application in real life?” “Isn’t this pretty much outdated” </i>But the corridors know better because it’s been the same old punctual professor who’s worked his way up the ranks but is stuck teaching twenty year olds the same fundamentals because no matter how much they’re questioned, the only thing that time is changing is the professor’s receding hairline and not his way of teaching.</p><p><i>“Let’s go to manali!”</i> Now this is the one phrase that literally never changes and is followed up after weeks pass with <i>“Next semester, for sure!” </i>and even the corridors laugh because it is this innocence of the moment and how years have gone but it still seems that they’ve hit pause on the brink of teenagers turning into adults and it’s now a rite of passage.</p><p>Illustration Credits: Atharva Pahilwan,1st year, B.Des.</p>",

Unlike its surroundings, which seemed to be brimming with untold stories and colourful gossip; a stony silence engulfed that corner of the library.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>And yet, fortuitously, in that seemingly spiritless area unfolded a conversation transcending through the gap of generations; when a flimsy newspaper titled ‘DCE Times,’ and a magazine by the name of ‘DTU Times,’ curiously eyed each other…</strong></p><p><strong>The older of the two looked away quickly and began mumbling something to itself, but not before passing a haughty smirk to its younger counterpart.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Perplexed and slightly offended, the younger one, flashing its shiny pages began, “Is there any way I can help you, my friend?” Its youthful, expressive voice was like a whiff of fresh air for the lonely elder.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Through its pages, which had also been shiny once but were now covered in dust and grime, it said, “My friend! Are these grey pages, flowing with inky experience, not enough to show just how much older I am than you?”&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>The elderly voice seemed strangely familiar to the youngster which was odd because the two hadn’t ever met before.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>With a muddled mind and uncertain eyes, they both quickly peeked at the title that adorned each of them. And then it hit both of them.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The times may have changed but the Times hadn’t. The pictures and the words still flowed the same way, and so did the dedication, effort and love that metamorphosed mere ideas and imaginations into actuality on paper.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>As the past and the present swelled with pride to realise how far they’ve come, and from where they’ve come respectively, they both eyed each other, yet again. But this time, the look was filled with newfound warmth and affection, a look that is reserved for ones that are our own.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>That dingy corner of the library continued to remain unnoticed. Students excitedly chattered their way into their surroundings, unmindful of how the stony silence of that corner had been converted into a perceptive peace by apparently inanimate bundles of paper.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Illustration Credits: Idhika, 1st year, B.

It seems like it was just yesterday when I was sitting at the oat with my seniors, and they told me this while all of us were listening to “Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hoon”. My golden days, they were indeed, everything was so simple yet so beautiful. I remember the only goals in my diary were going to college and vibing on “Kuch toh hua hai”. Rarely did I have those stretch marks on my forehead like the children these days. Yes, there was stress back then as well, but for who will buy the cassette of the latest songs first. It’s not that those days had no stress or things to worry about, but no matter what our problems used to be, we knew somehow our day would get its happy ending. From waiting eagerly with family to watch Ramayan to evening cricket sessions. While playing gully cricket, Lagaan’s “Baar Baar Haan” was the perfect competitive music we needed. With friends “Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan” made all of us smile with an unexpressed feeling of gratitude. Moreover, the campus knew some secretive beautiful stories from “Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga”, “Ye Dosti Hum Nahi Todenge”, and of course “Ramta Jogi”. Somehow that single radio made everything fall into place. Sometimes I wonder how lucky I was, as the heart knew what it always desired. Today when I see rock, hip-hop music, raps have conquered the market and more than half of the college would have them in their Spotify playlists, yet Lata Ji’s “Zindagi Aur Kuch Bhi Nahi Teri Meri Kahani Hai” has a special place in my heart. Well, I don't know about their choices but Arijit’s “Woh Din Bhi Kya Din” reminds me of those golden college days where life was just perfect and “Kal Ho Na Ho” was my very first mobile ringtone.</p><p><strong>Illustration credits: Shriyanshi Moharana, 1st year, B.Des</strong></p>",

I step back to reminisce about the past, that gushing feeling of uncertainty and excitement is anything but succinct as it lingers on fresh as ever. I ruminate about the myriad of questions that flowed from exhausting relatives, finding the answers to which had me running from post to poll . After all these years, my recollection of these uncertainties is but faint. However, there is one question that ceases to leave my memory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“What is DTU?”</p><p>&nbsp;An interesting question to ponder on contemplatively yet a question also asked from a space of genuine intrigue. A question asked to me by an alumnus taking the shape of my uncle to whom, ironically, I had gone for guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>25 years, an expanse of time morbidly large for us individuals, yet for an institute preceding our independence it is akin to a clap, the void between our hands covered instantaneously but the collision reverbing unabashed. A time ago in history when our institution became a deemed university, promptly accompanied by a name change. But for many the old name of “DCE” still rings true, evidently when even a graduate was befuddled. But to me the main crux of the conversation was the question which came after, “Why DTU?” At the time I gave superficial reasonings, reasonings I know to be false now. Reasonings taught to be reasoned about, conjecture only to placate expectations but being anything but pertinent.</p><p>Sneaking away to the neighbour’s house to eat a plethora of sweets unavailable to me at home, cracking the password my parents set on the cable, spending nights awake on my amphone, dreading an unannounced visit, and what I consider to be my pièce de resistance, almost setting the house on fire by lighting firecrackers indoors. These are but an inkling of the memories I do not choose to recall but come to me on their own accord. Some make me laugh, most make me cringe, but none make me regret, a feeling invariably growing as I mature.</p><p>Right now I am filled with nostalgia, an unseen warmth floods my body, permeating till the ends of every appendage.&nbsp; “We did not know we were making memories, we were just having fun”, a quote preached by a greater being, Winnie the Pooh being the bishop. I chose DTU to collect more of these droplets of time, keeping them unfiltered and raw, so that when the nights seem long, I can savour them and smile.</p>",
